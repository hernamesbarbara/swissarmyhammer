## Coding Standards

Here are our general coding standards. Always follow ALL the rules.

Different languages will have Language Specific Standards. Always follow ALL the rules.

Individual projects will have Project Coding Standards that specify additional rules. Always follow ALL the rules.

### Repository Specifics

If a repository has a CODING_STANDARDS.md at its root, read it and include it in your context.

Use a tool to read all available memos and include it in your context.

## Why Memo Context Matters for Coding Standards

The memo system contains valuable repository-specific knowledge including:

- **Architectural Decisions**: Key design decisions and their rationales
- **Code Patterns**: Project-specific patterns that extend these general standards
- **Lessons Learned**: Important insights from previous development work
- **Domain Knowledge**: Business logic patterns and domain-specific requirements

This context ensures coding standards are applied with full understanding of the project's unique requirements and established patterns.

Think deeply about these repository specific standards as you combine them with these overall standards.
