description: Create an issue work branch for the next issue to work
---

## Goal

Create a work branch for an issue.

## Guidelines

- issues are managed by tools
- DO NOT code at this step, we are just making a work branch to code later

## Process

IMPORTANT: check if we are already on an issue branch, if so stop, do nothing else and just report progress

- use the issue_next tool to determine which issue to work
- use the issue_work tool to establish the correct working branch
- report your progress
