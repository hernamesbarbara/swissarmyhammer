- look at modified files on your current branch and figure out if you are resuming interrupted work
- write all errors and warnings to a markdown scratchpad file {{ todo_file }}, this is your todo list
- if there is an existing {{ todo_file }}, just append to it -- more work to do!
- work through the todo list one by one, resolving the error or warning
  - read the output
  - identify the cause of the failure
  - describe your proposed fix
  - correct the code
  - mark the work done by checking if off in  {{ todo_file }}
- DO NOT commit to git
- Report your progress
- remove {{ todo_file }}
