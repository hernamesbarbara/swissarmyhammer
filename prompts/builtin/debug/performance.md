## Performance Investigation Strategy

### 1. Profiling Approach
- Identify bottlenecks using appropriate profiling tools
- Measure actual vs perceived performance
- Focus on the critical path

### 2. Common Performance Issues to Check
- **Algorithm Complexity**: O(nÂ²) or worse algorithms
- **Memory Issues**: Memory leaks, excessive allocations
- **I/O Bottlenecks**: Database queries, file operations, network calls
- **CPU Bound**: Intensive computations, inefficient loops
- **Concurrency**: Lock contention, synchronization overhead

### 3. Optimization Strategies
Based on the problem description, consider:
- Caching frequently accessed data
- Lazy loading and pagination
- Parallel processing where appropriate
- Algorithm optimization
- Database query optimization
- Resource pooling

### 4. Measurement and Validation
- Benchmark before and after changes
- Profile in production-like environment
- Monitor for regression
- Consider trade-offs (memory vs speed)

## Next Steps
1. Profile the specific operation
2. Identify the biggest bottleneck
3. Apply targeted optimization
4. Measure improvement
5. Iterate if needed
