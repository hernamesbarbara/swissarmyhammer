# Documentation Review

## Summary

The SwissArmyHammer documentation is comprehensive and well-structured, following mdBook conventions with proper organization and cross-references. The documentation includes excellent examples, clear API guidance, and follows the specified requirements from the review/documentation prompt. However, there are some minor discrepancies between documented features and actual built-in prompts that need updating.

- ✅ Excellent feature list with emoji indicators
- ✅ Proper architecture diagram
- ✅ Complete installation instructions
- ✅ Good examples demonstrating usage
- ✅ Links to comprehensive documentation

**Documentation Structure**:
- ✅ Well-organized SUMMARY.md with hierarchical structure
- ✅ Proper mdBook configuration in book.toml
- ✅ Comprehensive coverage of all major features
- ✅ Good cross-referencing between sections
- ✅ Proper Rust documentation links and API references

**Source Code Documentation**:
- ✅ Excellent rustdoc comments in lib.rs and prompts.rs
- ✅ Comprehensive examples in documentation comments
- ✅ Proper cross-referencing of types
- ✅ Clear module-level documentation

### ⚠️ Issues Found

#### Built-in Prompts Documentation Mismatch

**Issue**: The `doc/src/builtin-prompts.md` file describes built-in prompts that don't match the actual built-in prompts available in the system.

**Evidence**: 
- Documentation describes prompts like `statistics-calculator` and `email-composer`
- Actual built-in prompts include `are_issues_complete`, `branch`, `code/issue`, etc.
- The documented prompts appear to be examples rather than actual built-ins

**Impact**: Users following the documentation will not find the described prompts, causing confusion.

#### Quick Start Example Commands

**Issue**: Some quick start examples use `claude mcp add` command syntax that may not be current.

**Evidence**: In `doc/src/quick-start.md`, line 162 uses `claude mcp add --scope user swissarmyhammer swissarmyhammer serve` but this should be verified against current Claude Code MCP configuration.

#### Installation Documentation Gap

**Issue**: Installation documentation mentions that pre-built binaries are not available, but this may need updating based on current project status.

**Evidence**: `doc/src/installation.md` line 7: "Currently, SwissArmyHammer does not provide pre-built binaries for download."

## Improvements Needed

### 1. Fix Built-in Prompts Documentation

**Task**: Update `doc/src/builtin-prompts.md` to accurately reflect the actual built-in prompts available.

**Action Required**:
- Run `swissarmyhammer prompt list --source builtin` to get current list
- Document each actual built-in prompt with proper arguments and examples
- Remove or clearly mark fictional/example prompts
- Ensure all documented prompts actually exist in the `builtin/prompts/` directory

### 2. Verify and Update Installation Instructions

**Task**: Verify current installation methods and update documentation accordingly.

**Action Required**:
- Check if pre-built binaries are now available
- Verify the `claude mcp add` command syntax is current
- Update any outdated command examples

### 3. Cross-Reference Validation

**Task**: Ensure all cross-references in documentation point to existing content.

**Action Required**:
- Verify all internal links in SUMMARY.md resolve correctly
- Check that API documentation links are accurate
- Ensure example code in documentation matches current API

### 4. Add Missing Documentation Comments

**Task**: Ensure all public APIs have comprehensive documentation comments.

**Action Required**:
- Review modules like `workflow`, `issues`, `memoranda` for complete rustdoc coverage
- Add examples to any public functions missing them
- Ensure all public types are properly documented with cross-references

### 5. Update Code Examples

**Task**: Verify all code examples in documentation compile and work correctly.

**Action Required**:
- Test examples in `doc/src/library-usage.md`
- Verify CLI examples produce expected output
- Update any examples that use deprecated APIs

## Recommendations

### High Priority
1. **Fix builtin-prompts.md** - This is causing immediate user confusion
2. **Verify installation commands** - Critical for new users

### Medium Priority  
3. **Complete API documentation coverage** - Important for library users
4. **Update all code examples** - Ensures documentation stays current

### Low Priority
5. **Enhance examples with more use cases** - Improves user experience
6. **Add troubleshooting sections** - Helps with common issues

## Next Steps

1. Update `doc/src/builtin-prompts.md` with accurate prompt listings
2. Verify and update installation instructions
3. Test all code examples for accuracy
4. Review and enhance API documentation coverage
5. Rebuild documentation with `mdbook build` and verify all links work

The documentation foundation is excellent - these updates will make it even more accurate and helpful for users.
