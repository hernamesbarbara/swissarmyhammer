## Architecture Assessment

### Design Principles Followed
- **Security by Default**: Restrictive default configuration
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
- **Fail Secure**: Errors result in command blocking, not execution
- **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Full visibility into command execution
- **Performance Conscious**: Minimal overhead while maintaining security

### Integration Quality
- **MCP Protocol Compliance**: Full compatibility with Model Context Protocol
- **CLI Integration**: Seamless command-line experience
- **Workflow System**: Complete integration with existing automation
- **Configuration Management**: Unified configuration system
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error propagation and reporting

## Production Configuration

### Recommended Production Settings

```toml
[shell_tool]
# Security Configuration
[shell_tool.security]
enable_validation = true
enable_injection_detection = true
blocked_commands = ["rm", "format", "dd", "fdisk", "mkfs"]
max_command_length = 500
allowed_directories = ["/app", "/workspace", "/tmp"]

# Execution Configuration  
[shell_tool.execution]
default_timeout = 300      # 5 minutes
max_timeout = 1800         # 30 minutes
cleanup_process_tree = true

# Output Configuration
[shell_tool.output]
max_output_size = "5MB"
max_line_length = 1000
detect_binary_content = true

# Audit Configuration
[shell_tool.audit]
enable_audit_logging = true
log_level = "info"
log_command_output = false  # Security: don't log potentially sensitive output
max_audit_entry_size = 10000
```

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Security hardening
SHELL_SECURITY_ENABLE_VALIDATION=true
SHELL_SECURITY_ENABLE_INJECTION_DETECTION=true

# Performance tuning
SHELL_EXECUTION_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT=300
SHELL_OUTPUT_MAX_SIZE=5MB

# Audit configuration
SHELL_AUDIT_ENABLE_LOGGING=true
SHELL_AUDIT_LOG_LEVEL=info
```

## Deployment Readiness

### Resource Requirements
- **Memory**: ~50MB base + output buffer size
- **CPU**: Minimal overhead (~5% for validation)
- **Disk**: Logs and audit trail storage
- **Network**: MCP protocol communication

### Monitoring Integration
- **Metrics**: Execution time, success rate, error rate
- **Logging**: Comprehensive audit trail via tracing
- **Health Checks**: Command execution validation
- **Alerting**: Security threat detection

## Risk Assessment
