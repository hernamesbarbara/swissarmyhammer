# Step 29: Create SDK and Library API

## Goal
Refactor SwissArmyHammer to be usable as a Rust library, enabling developers to integrate prompt management into their own applications.

## Context
Currently SwissArmyHammer is CLI-only. Exposing core functionality as a library would enable integration into other tools, web services, and custom applications.

## Requirements
1. Library architecture:
   - Separate `swissarmyhammer` library crate from binary
   - Clean public API with proper documentation
   - Feature flags for optional dependencies
   - Async and sync API variants
2. Core API modules:
   - `swissarmyhammer::prompts` - prompt loading and management
   - `swissarmyhammer::template` - template engine
   - `swissarmyhammer::mcp` - MCP server components
   - `swissarmyhammer::storage` - prompt storage abstraction
3. Public API design:
   ```rust
   // Example usage
   use swissarmyhammer::{PromptLibrary, Template};
   
   let mut library = PromptLibrary::new();
   library.add_directory("./prompts")?;
   
   let prompt = library.get("code-review")?;
   let rendered = prompt.render(args)?;
   ```
4. Advanced features:
   - Custom storage backends (S3, database)
   - Plugin system for template functions
   - Event hooks for prompt lifecycle
   - Streaming template processing
5. Language bindings:
   - Python bindings via PyO3
   - Node.js bindings via neon
   - WASM support for browser usage

## Implementation Notes
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Use `cargo workspaces` for organization
- Comprehensive documentation with examples
- Consider API stability guarantees
- Benchmark performance impact

## Success Criteria
- Library can be added as Cargo dependency
- API is intuitive and well-documented
- Examples show common use cases
- Performance overhead is minimal
- Breaking changes follow semver
