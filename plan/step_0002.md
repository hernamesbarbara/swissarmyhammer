# Step 2: Implement CLI Framework with clap

## Goal
Build a robust CLI interface using clap that provides excellent user experience similar to popular Rust CLI tools like `uv` and `ripgrep`.

## Context
Following the success patterns of tools like `uv`, we want to create a CLI that is:
- Fast and responsive
- Has helpful error messages
- Provides clear usage instructions
- Supports subcommands elegantly

## Requirements
1. Update main.rs to use clap with derive API
2. Implement the following CLI structure:
   ```
   swissarmyhammer [OPTIONS] [COMMAND]
   
   Commands:
     serve    Run as MCP server (default when invoked via stdio)
     doctor   Diagnose configuration and setup issues
     help     Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)
   
   Options:
     -v, --verbose    Enable verbose logging
     -q, --quiet      Suppress all output except errors
     --version        Print version information
   ```
3. When run without arguments in a terminal (detected via isatty), show:
   - Brief description of what swissarmyhammer is
   - Instructions on how to add it to Claude Code's MCP config
   - Example configuration snippet
4. Implement proper exit codes:
   - 0 for success
   - 1 for general errors
   - 2 for CLI usage errors
5. Add colored output support (but respect NO_COLOR and detect non-TTY)

## Implementation Notes
- Use `clap` version 4.x with derive feature
- Use `colored` crate for terminal colors
- Use `atty` or `is-terminal` to detect TTY
- Structure code so CLI parsing is separate from business logic
- Create a `cli` module for all CLI-related code

## Success Criteria
- `swissarmyhammer --help` shows well-formatted help
- `swissarmyhammer --version` shows version
- Running without args in terminal shows helpful setup instructions
- Running with invalid args shows clear error messages
- Colors work in terminal but are disabled in pipes
