# Step 4: Implement Prompt Discovery and Loading

## Goal
Build the system to discover and load markdown files from `.swissarmyhammer` directories as prompts.

## Context
Prompts are markdown files that can be placed in various `.swissarmyhammer` directories. The file name (without .md extension) becomes the prompt name.

## Requirements
1. Create a `prompts` module with the following functionality:
   - `PromptLoader` struct to manage prompt discovery
   - `Prompt` struct to represent a loaded prompt
   - Function to scan directories for .md files
2. Implement directory scanning in this order:
   - Built-in prompts from `var/prompts/` (compiled into binary)
   - User prompts from `~/.swissarmyhammer/`
   - Local prompts from `$PWD/.swissarmyhammer/`
3. For built-in prompts:
   - Use `include_str!` or `rust-embed` to embed files
   - Create at least one example prompt in `var/prompts/example.md`
4. File discovery logic:
   - Recursively scan each directory for .md files
   - Extract prompt name from file path (e.g., `tools/debug.md` â†’ `tools/debug`)
   - Store full content for later parsing
5. Implement proper error handling:
   - Missing directories are okay (just skip)
   - Invalid files should log warnings but not crash
   - Permission errors should be handled gracefully

## Implementation Notes
- Use `walkdir` crate for recursive directory traversal
- Use `dirs` crate to find home directory
- Consider using `rust-embed` for built-in prompts
- Keep file paths relative for override logic (step 6)
- Store discovered prompts in a HashMap or similar structure

## Success Criteria
- Can discover .md files from all three locations
- Built-in example prompt is always available
- Handles missing directories gracefully
- Can list all discovered prompts with their source paths
