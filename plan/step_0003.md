# Step 3: Study MCP SDK and Protocol Basics

## Goal
Understand the MCP (Model Context Protocol) SDK and implement basic MCP server structure using the official Rust SDK.

## Context
MCP is a protocol for AI applications to connect with external tools and data sources. We need to understand how to use the official `modelcontextprotocol/rust-sdk` to build our server.

## Requirements
1. Add MCP SDK dependency to Cargo.toml:
   - Research and add the correct crate name from the official SDK
   - Note: The SDK might be called `rmcp` or similar
2. Study the MCP protocol specification:
   - Understand JSON-RPC message format
   - Learn about stdio transport (stdin/stdout communication)
   - Understand the handshake process
3. Create basic MCP server structure:
   - Create `src/mcp/mod.rs` module
   - Implement minimal MCP server that can:
     - Accept initialize request
     - Respond with server capabilities
     - Handle the initialized notification
     - Properly handle shutdown
4. Update the `serve` command to:
   - Start the MCP server on stdio
   - Handle JSON-RPC messages from stdin
   - Send responses to stdout
   - Log debug info to stderr
5. Test with MCP Inspector or similar tool

## Implementation Notes
- Study examples from the official SDK repository
- Look at other Rust MCP implementations for patterns
- Ensure proper async handling with tokio
- Handle graceful shutdown on SIGTERM/SIGINT
- All logging must go to stderr to keep stdout clean for protocol

## Success Criteria
- Server starts and accepts MCP initialize request
- Returns proper server info and capabilities
- Can be tested with MCP Inspector
- Gracefully shuts down on request
