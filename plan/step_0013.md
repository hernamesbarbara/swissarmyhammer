# Step 13: Packaging and Distribution

## Goal
Set up proper packaging and distribution channels to make swissarmyhammer easy to install and update.

## Context
Following the example of successful Rust tools, we want multiple installation methods and automatic updates.

## Requirements
1. GitHub Release Pipeline:
   - Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD
   - Build binaries for major platforms:
     - macOS (x86_64, aarch64)
     - Linux (x86_64, aarch64, musl variants)
     - Windows (x86_64)
   - Create automated releases with changelogs
   - Generate checksums for all artifacts
2. Installation methods:
   - Direct binary download from GitHub releases
   - Homebrew formula for macOS
   - Cargo install from crates.io
   - Shell installer script (curl | sh style)
   - Consider apt/yum repositories later
3. Binary optimization:
   - Use `--release` with optimizations
   - Strip debug symbols
   - Use LTO (Link Time Optimization)
   - Consider UPX compression if needed
   - Target <10MB binary size
4. Version management:
   - Use semantic versioning
   - Embed version in binary
   - Support `--version` flag
   - Add version check/update notification
5. Documentation:
   - Installation instructions for each platform
   - Quickstart guide
   - Configuration examples
   - Troubleshooting guide

## Implementation Notes
- Use `cargo-dist` or similar for releases
- Sign binaries if possible
- Test installation methods in CI
- Make installation one-liner where possible

## Success Criteria
- Binary available for all major platforms
- Installation takes <30 seconds
- Multiple installation methods work
- Automatic updates available
- Clear documentation for each method
