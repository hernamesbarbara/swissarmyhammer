# Step 12: Create Built-in Prompts Library

## Goal
Develop a comprehensive set of built-in prompts that demonstrate the power of swissarmyhammer and provide immediate value to users.

## Context
Good built-in prompts will help users understand the capability of the system and serve as examples for creating their own prompts.

## Requirements
1. Create prompts in `var/prompts/` organized by category:
   - `debug/` - Debugging assistance prompts
   - `refactor/` - Code refactoring prompts
   - `review/` - Code review prompts
   - `docs/` - Documentation generation prompts
   - `test/` - Test generation prompts
2. Essential built-in prompts:
   - `help.md` - Get help with using swissarmyhammer
   - `plan.md` - Plan implementation of features
   - `debug/error.md` - Debug error messages
   - `refactor/clean.md` - Clean up code
   - `review/security.md` - Security review
   - `docs/readme.md` - Generate README
   - `test/unit.md` - Generate unit tests
3. Prompt quality standards:
   - Clear, instructive YAML front matter
   - Well-documented arguments
   - Examples in the prompt content
   - Explanation of when to use the prompt
4. Advanced prompts with multiple arguments:
   - Show off template capabilities
   - Demonstrate optional vs required arguments
   - Use default values effectively
5. Meta prompts:
   - `prompts/create.md` - Help create new prompts
   - `prompts/improve.md` - Improve existing prompts
