# Step 11: Comprehensive Testing and Polish

## Goal
Add comprehensive tests, improve error handling, and polish the user experience to match the quality of popular Rust CLI tools.

## Context
Following the example of successful Rust tools like `uv` and `ripgrep`, we need excellent test coverage and a polished user experience.

## Requirements
1. Unit tests:
   - Test prompt parsing with various YAML formats
   - Test override logic with different scenarios
   - Test template substitution edge cases
   - Test MCP message handling
   - Achieve >80% code coverage
2. Integration tests:
   - Test full prompt discovery across directories
   - Test file watching and reload
   - Test MCP server communication
   - Test CLI commands and arguments
3. Error handling improvements:
   - Replace all `unwrap()` with proper error handling
   - Add context to errors using `anyhow`
   - Ensure all errors are user-friendly
   - Never panic in production code
4. Performance optimization:
   - Profile startup time
   - Optimize prompt loading for large directories
   - Implement lazy loading where appropriate
   - Target <50ms startup time
5. Polish items:
   - Add shell completion scripts (bash, zsh, fish)
   - Improve help text with examples
   - Add man page generation
   - Create animated demo for README
   - Add badges (CI, version, downloads)

## Implementation Notes
- Use `cargo test` for unit tests
- Use `assert_cmd` for CLI testing
- Use `proptest` for property-based testing
- Use `criterion` for benchmarks
- Generate completions with clap

## Success Criteria
- All tests pass on CI
- No panics in any code path
- Startup time <50ms
- Error messages are helpful
- Tool feels professional and polished
