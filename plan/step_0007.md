# Step 7: Implement File Watching and Auto-reload

## Goal
Add file system watching to automatically reload prompts when markdown files are created, modified, or deleted.

## Context
Users want their prompt changes to be reflected immediately without restarting the server, providing a smooth development experience.

## Requirements
1. Add file watching dependencies:
   - Use `notify` crate for cross-platform file watching
   - Configure debouncing to avoid rapid reloads
2. Implement `PromptWatcher`:
   - Watch all `.swissarmyhammer` directories (user and local)
   - Don't watch built-in prompts (they're compiled in)
   - Detect create, modify, delete, and rename events
3. Reload strategy:
   - On file change, reload only affected prompt
   - On directory change, rescan that directory
   - Maintain prompt cache for performance
   - Apply override logic after each reload
4. Thread safety:
   - Use Arc<RwLock<>> or similar for prompt storage
   - Ensure concurrent access is safe
   - Don't block MCP requests during reload
5. Add reload notifications:
   - Log when prompts are reloaded
   - Track reload statistics (for doctor command)
   - Handle errors gracefully (corrupted files, etc.)

## Implementation Notes
- Set up watcher in a separate tokio task
- Use channels to communicate changes
- Debounce events (e.g., 100ms) to handle rapid saves
- Consider using `dashmap` for concurrent HashMap
- Make watching optional via CLI flag if needed

## Success Criteria
- Editing a prompt file reflects changes immediately
- Creating new prompt files makes them available
- Deleting prompt files removes them
- No race conditions or crashes during reload
- Performance remains good with many prompts
