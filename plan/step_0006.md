# Step 6: Implement Prompt Stacking and Override Logic

## Goal
Implement the stacking nature where prompts can override each other based on their source location (built-in → user → local).

## Context
Prompts with the same relative path should override in priority order, allowing users to customize built-in prompts or override their own user-level prompts with project-specific versions.

## Requirements
1. Enhance `PromptLoader` to handle overrides:
   - Track source location for each prompt (built-in, user, local)
   - Use relative path as the key for override detection
   - Higher priority sources override lower priority
2. Priority order (highest to lowest):
   - Local: `$PWD/.swissarmyhammer/`
   - User: `~/.swissarmyhammer/`
   - Built-in: `var/prompts/`
3. Implement override logic:
   - When loading prompts, check if one already exists with same path
   - Replace lower priority with higher priority
   - Log when overrides occur (debug level)
4. Add source tracking:
   - Each prompt should know where it came from
   - Include source in prompt metadata for debugging
   - Useful for the `doctor` command later
5. Create test scenario:
   - Built-in `example.md`
   - User override in `~/.swissarmyhammer/example.md`
   - Local override in `./.swissarmyhammer/example.md`
   - Verify correct override is loaded

## Implementation Notes
- Use an enum for source types (BuiltIn, User, Local)
- Consider using a priority value for easier comparison
- Make the loading order explicit and easy to understand
- Keep track of all overridden prompts for diagnostics

## Success Criteria
- Prompts override correctly based on priority
- Can see which prompt "won" and why
- Override logic is clearly logged
- Test scenario demonstrates all three levels
