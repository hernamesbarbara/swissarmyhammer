# Step 21: Add Search Command for Finding Prompts

## Goal
Implement a `search` command that allows users to quickly find prompts by name, description, content, or tags.

## Context
As prompt libraries grow, users need efficient ways to discover relevant prompts. A powerful search feature improves productivity and prompt reuse.

## Requirements
1. Add `search` subcommand to the CLI:
   - Basic search: `swissarmyhammer search "code review"`
   - Search in specific fields: `--in name,description,content`
   - Case-insensitive by default, `--case-sensitive` flag
   - Regular expression support with `--regex` flag
2. Search capabilities:
   - Fuzzy matching for typo tolerance
   - Rank results by relevance
   - Highlight matching terms in output
   - Search in prompt arguments and their descriptions
3. Output formatting:
   - Show prompt name, title, and matching excerpt
   - `--full` flag to show complete prompt details
   - `--json` output for tool integration
   - Limit results with `--limit N`
4. Advanced filters:
   - `--source` to search only in built-in/user/local
   - `--has-arg` to find prompts with specific arguments
   - `--no-args` to find prompts without arguments
   - Combine with list command filters

## Implementation Notes
- Use `tantivy` or similar for efficient full-text search
- Build search index on run, in memory
- Consider `skim` or `fzf`-style interactive search mode

## Success Criteria
- Users can quickly find relevant prompts
- Search is fast even with hundreds of prompts
- Fuzzy matching helps with misspellings
- Output clearly shows why each result matched
- Search index updates automatically with file changes
