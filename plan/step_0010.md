# Step 10: Implement Doctor Command

## Goal
Create a comprehensive diagnostic command that helps users troubleshoot issues with their swissarmyhammer setup.

## Context
The `doctor` command should diagnose common problems and provide clear guidance on how to fix them, similar to tools like `brew doctor`.

## Requirements
1. Implement diagnostic checks:
   - Check if swissarmyhammer is in PATH
   - Verify Claude Code MCP configuration
   - List all prompt directories being scanned
   - Show number of prompts found in each location
   - Identify any file permission issues
   - Check for YAML parsing errors in prompts
   - Verify file watching is working
2. Configuration detection:
   - Look for Claude Code config file
   - Parse existing MCP server configurations
   - Detect if swissarmyhammer is already configured
   - Suggest correct configuration if missing
3. Output format:
   - Use colored output for status (✓ green, ✗ red, ⚠ yellow)
   - Group checks by category
   - Show detailed error messages and fixes
   - Provide copy-paste ready configuration snippets
4. Advanced diagnostics:
   - Test MCP protocol communication
   - Show prompt override information
   - List recently reloaded prompts
   - Display file watcher status
5. Exit codes:
   - 0 if all checks pass
   - 1 if there are warnings
   - 2 if there are errors

## Implementation Notes
- Make output beautiful and easy to read
- Provide actionable fixes for each issue
- Consider adding a `--verbose` flag for more details
- Test on different platforms (macOS, Linux, Windows)

## Success Criteria
- Doctor command runs all checks successfully
- Identifies common configuration issues
- Provides clear, actionable fixes
- Output is well-formatted and colored
- Helps users get up and running quickly
