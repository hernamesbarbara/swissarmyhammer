Review all commands in the CLI and identify any commands that are implementing what should be in ./swissarmyhammer.

Remember that the CLI should be a way to directly call tools.

The idea is that there are tools, and these are called via MCP server and via CLI by the user.

There should not be any logic in the CLI except passing along parameters to tools, and formatting outputs for a beautiful CLI experience.
