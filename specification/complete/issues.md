# Overview

Track issues directly in the repository, storing them in as files in git, with an MCP server.

## Rules

Issues are individual markdown files stored in the root of a repository in `./issues`.

Each Issue describes work to be done in markdown.

When issues are completed, they are moved to `./issues/complete`.

Each issue file name starts with a 6 digit increasing integer, like `<nnnnnn>_<more naming>.md`.

The file name before the .md is used as the issue name like `<issue_name>.md`

When a new issue is created, it need to start with the next highest number so that issues are sequential.

Issues are always worked on a work branch named `issue/<issue_name>`

## Use Cases

This will be an MCP Tool capability to swissarmyhammer.
Think deeply about creating great descriptions of the tool capability to allow Claude to call it reliably.
Research best practices for making MCP tools.

Swissarmyhammer now has multiple MCP tools, so calling them just 'mcp' is a bad idea.
