# Worktree-Based Issue Management

## Overview

This specification outlines the migration from in-place branching to git worktree-based issue management for the Swiss Army Hammer MCP tools. The goal is to improve isolation between issues and provide cleaner workspace management.

## Current Implementation

The existing issue workflow uses in-place branching:

1. `issue_work` creates/switches to branch `issue/<issue_name>` 
2. Work is done in the main repository directory
3. `issue_merge` merges the branch back to main and optionally deletes the branch

**Current Git Operations** (from `git.rs:120-267`):
- `create_work_branch()` - Creates `issue/<issue_name>` branch from main
- `merge_issue_branch()` - Merges branch back to main with `--no-ff`
- `delete_branch()` - Removes branch after merge

## Proposed Worktree Implementation

### Directory Structure

```
project-root/
├── .swissarmyhammer/
│   └── worktrees/
│       ├── issue-<issue_name>/  # Worktree for each issue
│       └── ...
├── .git/
└── ... (main repo files)
```

### New Git Operations

1. **Create Worktree** (`create_work_worktree`)
   - Create branch `issue/<issue_name>` from main
   - Create worktree at `.swissarmyhammer/worktrees/issue-<issue_name>/`
   - Link worktree to the new branch

2. **Merge Worktree** (`merge_issue_worktree`)
   - Switch to main branch in main repo
   - Merge branch `issue/<issue_name>` to main
   - Remove worktree directory
   - Delete branch

### Implementation Changes

#### New Git Commands

```rust
impl GitOperations {
    pub fn create_work_worktree(&self, issue_name: &str) -> Result<String> {
        let branch_name = format!("issue/{issue_name}");
        let worktree_path = self.get_worktree_path(issue_name);
        
        // Ensure worktree directory exists
        self.ensure_worktree_base_dir()?;
        
        // Create branch and worktree
        if !self.branch_exists(&branch_name)? {
            self.create_branch_and_worktree(&branch_name, &worktree_path)?;
        } else {
            self.create_worktree_for_existing_branch(&branch_name, &worktree_path)?;
        }
        
        Ok(worktree_path)
    }
    
    pub fn merge_issue_worktree(&self, issue_name: &str) -> Result<()> {
        let branch_name = format!("issue/{issue_name}");
        let worktree_path = self.get_worktree_path(issue_name);
        
        // Merge branch to main
        self.merge_issue_branch(&branch_name)?;
        
        // Remove worktree
        self.remove_worktree(&worktree_path)?;
        
        Ok(())
    }
    
    pub fn get_current_worktree(&self) -> Result<Option<String>> {
        // List all worktrees and find the first one in .swissarmyhammer/worktrees/
        let output = Command::new("git")
            .current_dir(&self.work_dir)
            .args(["worktree", "list", "--porcelain"])
            .output()?;
            
        if !output.status.success() {
            return Ok(None);
        }
        
        let output_str = String::from_utf8_lossy(&output.stdout);
        for line in output_str.lines() {
            if let Some(path) = line.strip_prefix("worktree ") {
                if path.contains("/.swissarmyhammer/worktrees/issue-") {
                    // Extract issue name from path
                    if let Some(issue_name) = path.split("issue-").nth(1) {
                        return Ok(Some(issue_name.to_string()));
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        Ok(None)
    }
    
    fn get_worktree_path(&self, issue_name: &str) -> String {
        format!("{}/.swissarmyhammer/worktrees/issue-{}", 
                self.work_dir.display(), issue_name)
    }
}
```

#### MCP Tool Updates

**WorkIssueTool** (`work/mod.rs:48-78`):
- Replace `create_work_branch()` call with `create_work_worktree()`
- Return worktree path instead of branch name
- Update success message to indicate worktree location

**MergeIssueTool** (`merge/mod.rs:58-143`):
- Replace `merge_issue_branch()` call with `merge_issue_worktree()`
- Add worktree cleanup to success message
- Handle worktree removal errors gracefully

**CurrentIssueTool** (`current/mod.rs`):
- Replace branch detection logic with `get_current_worktree()`
- Return the first active worktree instead of current branch
- Update response to show worktree path and issue name

### Benefits

1. **Isolation**: Each issue has its own complete workspace
2. **Parallel Work**: Multiple issues can be worked on simultaneously
3. **Clean State**: No need to stash/commit when switching issues
4. **Simplified Workflow**: No branch switching in main repo

### Migration Considerations

1. **Backward Compatibility**: Do nothing for backward compatibility, the app is not released yet
2. **Error Handling**: Robust cleanup of failed worktree operations
3. **Path Management**: Ensure worktree paths don't conflict
4. **Integration**: Update CLI and MCP tools consistently

### File Changes Required

1. **Core Git Operations** (`swissarmyhammer/src/git.rs`)
   - Add worktree creation/removal methods
   - Update existing branch operations
   - Add worktree path utilities

2. **MCP Tools** (`swissarmyhammer/src/mcp/tools/issues/`)
   - Update `work/mod.rs` for worktree creation
   - Update `merge/mod.rs` for worktree cleanup
   - Update `current/mod.rs` to detect active worktree instead of current branch
   - Update response messages

3. **CLI Integration** (`swissarmyhammer-cli/src/issue.rs`)
   - CLI needs to 'just work' as it is calling the MCP tools
   - Handle worktree path display

4. **Tests**
   - Update integration tests for worktree operations
   - Add worktree-specific test cases


### Configuration

Add configuration option for worktree base directory:
```rust
pub struct WorktreeConfig {
    pub base_dir: String, // Default: ".swissarmyhammer/worktrees"
    pub auto_cleanup: bool, // Default: true
}
```

This specification provides a foundation for implementing worktree-based issue management that improves workspace isolation while maintaining the existing workflow patterns.
