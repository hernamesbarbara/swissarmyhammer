# Step 7: Performance Monitoring and Regression Prevention

Refer to /Users/wballard/sah-slow_tests/ideas/slow_tests.md

## Objective
Establish performance monitoring and regression prevention mechanisms to ensure test suite performance improvements are maintained and new slow tests are identified early.

## Background
After optimizing slow tests across all categories, we need to prevent performance regressions and maintain the improved test suite performance over time. This includes monitoring, tooling, and process improvements.

## Tasks

### 1. Establish Performance Baselines
- **Record Current Performance**: Document test execution times after optimizations
- **Create Performance Profiles**: Track performance by test category and package
- **Set Performance Thresholds**: Define acceptable test execution time limits  
- **Document Performance Standards**: Update coding standards with test performance expectations

### 2. Implement Performance Monitoring
- **CI Performance Tracking**: Add test performance monitoring to CI/CD pipeline
- **Performance Regression Detection**: Automatically flag tests that become slow
- **Test Timing Reports**: Generate reports on test suite performance trends
- **Alert Mechanisms**: Notify developers when performance thresholds are exceeded

### 3. Create Performance Testing Tools
- **Test Performance Profiler**: Tool to identify slow tests during development
- **Performance Regression Detector**: Tool to compare test performance across commits
- **Test Suite Optimizer**: Tool to suggest optimizations for slow tests
- **Benchmarking Framework**: Consistent way to measure test performance improvements

### 4. Establish Performance Guidelines
- **Test Performance Standards**: Clear guidelines for acceptable test execution times
- **Code Review Checklist**: Include test performance evaluation in reviews
- **Test Design Patterns**: Document patterns for writing fast, parallelizable tests
- **Performance Best Practices**: Guidelines for avoiding common performance pitfalls

### 5. Implement Continuous Performance Monitoring

#### CI Performance Integration
```yaml
# .github/workflows/test-performance.yml
name: Test Performance Monitoring
on: [pull_request]

jobs:
  test-performance:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      
      - name: Run Test Suite with Performance Tracking
        run: |
          cargo nextest run --profile default --message-format json > test-results.json
          
      - name: Analyze Test Performance
        run: |
          ./scripts/analyze-test-performance.sh test-results.json
          
      - name: Check for Performance Regressions
        run: |
          ./scripts/check-performance-regression.sh
```

#### Performance Monitoring Script
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# scripts/analyze-test-performance.sh

# Extract test timing data from nextest output
jq -r '.tests[] | select(.execution_time > 10) | "\(.name): \(.execution_time)s"' test-results.json > slow-tests.txt

if [ -s slow-tests.txt ]; then
    echo "⚠️  Slow tests detected (>10s):"
    cat slow-tests.txt
    exit 1
fi
```

### 6. Create Performance Documentation
- **Performance Optimization Guide**: Document strategies used to optimize tests
- **Test Performance FAQ**: Common questions about test performance optimization
- **Troubleshooting Guide**: How to diagnose and fix slow tests
- **Migration Guide**: How to upgrade existing tests to use performance patterns

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Performance baselines established for optimized test suite
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline includes automated performance monitoring
- [ ] Performance regression detection alerts developers to slow tests
- [ ] Test performance standards documented and enforced
- [ ] Performance optimization tools and scripts created
- [ ] Code review process includes test performance evaluation
- [ ] Performance documentation created for team reference
- [ ] Automated prevention of performance regressions

## Implementation Strategy

### Performance Monitoring Components
1. **Baseline Measurement**: Record post-optimization performance metrics
2. **Automated Detection**: CI scripts to identify performance regressions
3. **Reporting Dashboard**: Visual tracking of test suite performance trends  
4. **Alert System**: Notifications when performance thresholds exceeded
5. **Documentation**: Comprehensive guide for maintaining test performance

### Performance Thresholds
- **Individual Test Limit**: 10 seconds per test (per coding standards)
- **Test Suite Limit**: Target <5 minutes total execution time
- **Category Limits**: Specific limits per test category (unit: <1s, integration: <5s, E2E: <10s)
- **Regression Threshold**: Alert if test performance degrades by >20%

### Integration Points
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Optional performance checks before commits
- **Pull Request Checks**: Automated performance analysis for PRs
- **Release Gates**: Performance validation before releases
- **Developer Tools**: Local performance profiling and optimization tools

## Estimated Effort
Medium (4-5 focused work sessions)

## Dependencies
- All previous steps (1-6) completed to establish optimized baseline
- CI/CD pipeline access for performance monitoring integration

## Follow-up Steps
- Ongoing maintenance and refinement of performance monitoring
- This completes the slow test optimization implementation plan

## Long-term Maintenance
- Regular review of performance baselines and thresholds
- Continuous improvement of performance monitoring tools
- Training team members on test performance best practices
- Evolution of performance standards as the codebase grows
