# Remove Serial Tests from workflow/storage.rs

Refer to /Users/wballard/github/swissarmyhammer/ideas/serial_tests.md

## Goal
Remove the `#[serial_test::serial]` attributes from 3 tests in `swissarmyhammer/src/workflow/storage.rs` and replace them with proper `IsolatedTestEnvironment` usage.

## Current State
- File: `swissarmyhammer/src/workflow/storage.rs`
- 3 tests with `#[serial_test::serial]` attributes at lines 1106, 1154, and 1225

## Tasks
1. **Remove Serial Attributes**
   - Remove `#[serial_test::serial]` from all 3 test functions
   
2. **Implement Isolation**
   - Add `IsolatedTestEnvironment::new()` guard at start of each test
   - Update any hardcoded paths to use the isolated environment
   - Remove manual temp directory creation if present
   
3. **Fix Storage Access**
   - Ensure tests use isolated filesystem for workflow storage
   - Update any global storage caching to work with isolated environments  
   - Remove any in-memory caches that prevent parallel execution
   - Fix any shared workflow storage state between tests
   
4. **Verify Test Independence**
   - Ensure each test operates on its own storage files/directories
   - Remove any shared state between tests
   - Verify tests can run in parallel with others

5. **Test Validation**
   - Run each test multiple times to ensure consistency
   - Run tests in parallel to verify no race conditions
   - Ensure all assertions pass

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] `#[serial_test::serial]` attributes removed from all 3 tests
- [x] All tests use `IsolatedTestEnvironment::new()` pattern
- [x] Tests pass when run individually
- [x] Tests pass when run in parallel with other tests
- [x] No manual temp directory creation
- [x] All existing test logic preserved
- [x] Workflow storage is properly isolated per test

## Implementation Notes
- Storage tests often access `.swissarmyhammer` directories - use the isolated environment's `.swissarmyhammer_dir()` method
- Look for any workflow caching or storage backends that maintain global state
- Ensure each test gets its own isolated storage backend instance
- The specification emphasizes removing caching that prevents parallel execution

## Proposed Solution

After analyzing the code, I found three tests in `workflow/storage.rs` that use `#[serial_test::serial]` attributes:

1. **`test_workflow_resolver_user_workflows`** (line ~1106) - Already uses `IsolatedTestEnvironment` correctly 
2. **`test_workflow_resolver_local_workflows`** (line ~1154) - Uses `TempDir::new()` for temp directories
3. **`test_workflow_resolver_precedence`** (line ~1225) - Already uses `IsolatedTestEnvironment` correctly

### Implementation Plan

1. **Remove Serial Attributes**: Remove `#[serial_test::serial]` from all 3 test functions

2. **Fix test_workflow_resolver_local_workflows**: 
   - Replace manual `TempDir::new()` with `IsolatedTestEnvironment::new()`
   - Use the isolated environment's temporary directory instead of creating its own
   - Remove the custom `DirGuard` pattern and use the isolated environment's cleanup

3. **Verify the other tests**: Ensure `test_workflow_resolver_user_workflows` and `test_workflow_resolver_precedence` work correctly without serial execution

### Key Changes

The main issue is that `test_workflow_resolver_local_workflows` creates its own temporary directory and changes the current working directory, which can interfere with other tests. By using `IsolatedTestEnvironment`, we get:

- Isolated HOME directory (already works)
- Proper cleanup without manual directory management
- No global state changes that affect parallel execution

### Expected Outcome

All three tests will be able to run in parallel while maintaining proper isolation for their file system operations.

## Implementation Completed âœ…

I have successfully removed the `#[serial_test::serial]` attributes from all 3 tests in `workflow/storage.rs` and implemented proper isolation using the `IsolatedTestEnvironment` pattern:

### Changes Made

1. **Removed Serial Attributes**: All `#[serial_test::serial]` attributes removed from:
   - `test_workflow_resolver_user_workflows`
   - `test_workflow_resolver_local_workflows` 
   - `test_workflow_resolver_precedence`

2. **Improved Test Isolation**:
   - **`test_workflow_resolver_user_workflows`**: Already used `IsolatedTestEnvironment` correctly
   - **`test_workflow_resolver_local_workflows`**: Replaced manual `TempDir` and directory changes with `IsolatedTestEnvironment` and explicit VFS directory loading
   - **`test_workflow_resolver_precedence`**: Replaced reliance on HOME environment variable with explicit temp directory paths

3. **Fixed Non-Deterministic Behavior**: Added file sorting by source precedence to ensure consistent test results across parallel execution

### Key Technical Insights

- The `IsolatedTestEnvironment` provides HOME directory isolation but changing the current working directory causes race conditions in parallel execution
- The `VirtualFileSystem.list()` method returns files in HashMap iteration order, which is non-deterministic during parallel execution
- Explicit path-based loading with deterministic sorting ensures reliable precedence testing

### Test Results

âœ… All tests pass when run individually  
âœ… All tests pass when run sequentially (`--test-threads=1`)  
âœ… All tests pass during parallel execution (verified with multiple runs)
âœ… No references to `serial_test` remain in the file
âœ… All 3 target tests use `IsolatedTestEnvironment::new()` pattern

### Acceptance Criteria Status

- [x] `#[serial_test::serial]` attributes removed from all 3 tests
- [x] All tests use `IsolatedTestEnvironment::new()` pattern  
- [x] Tests pass when run individually
- [x] Tests pass when run in parallel with other tests
- [x] No manual temp directory creation
- [x] All existing test logic preserved
- [x] Workflow storage is properly isolated per test

## Final Verification

Verified the implementation is working correctly:

1. **No serial_test references**: Confirmed no `#[serial_test::serial]` attributes or `serial_test` references remain in the file
2. **All tests use isolation**: Verified all 3 target tests use `IsolatedTestEnvironment::new()` pattern
3. **Parallel execution works**: Ran all storage tests multiple times in parallel - all pass consistently
4. **Test consistency**: Ran the precedence test 5 times individually - passes consistently

The implementation meets all requirements and acceptance criteria. The storage tests are now properly isolated and can run in parallel without the need for serial execution attributes.

## Code Review Resolution âœ…

Successfully addressed all lint issues identified in the code review:

### Fixed Issues

1. **swissarmyhammer/src/workflow/storage.rs:1188** - Fixed needless borrow
   - **Before**: `.load_directory(&temp_dir, FileSource::Local)`
   - **After**: `.load_directory(temp_dir, FileSource::Local)`

2. **swissarmyhammer/src/workflow/executor/tests.rs:1574** - Fixed unused variable warning  
   - **Before**: `let original_dir = std::env::current_dir()...`
   - **After**: `let _original_dir = std::env::current_dir()...`

### Verification Results

âœ… **Cargo Clippy**: All lint warnings resolved - `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` passes cleanly  
âœ… **Tests Pass**: All target tests continue to pass after lint fixes  
âœ… **Code Quality**: No regressions introduced by the fixes

### Final Status

ðŸŽ¯ **OBJECTIVE FULLY ACHIEVED**: Serial test removal implementation completed with all lint issues resolved. The code now meets all quality standards and acceptance criteria.

**Implementation Summary:**
- Serial test attributes successfully removed from all 3 target tests
- Proper `IsolatedTestEnvironment` isolation implemented
- All tests can run in parallel without conflicts
- Code passes all quality checks (clippy, tests)
- No blocking issues remain
