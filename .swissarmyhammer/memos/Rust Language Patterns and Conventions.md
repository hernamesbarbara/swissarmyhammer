# SwissArmyHammer Rust Language Patterns and Conventions

## Type Safety Patterns

**Newtype Pattern for Domain Safety**
```rust
pub struct MemoId(String);          // ULID wrapper
pub struct IssueName(pub String);   // Validated issue names  
pub struct WorkflowName(String);    // Workflow identifiers
pub struct StateId(String);         // State identifiers
```

**Type Aliases for Clarity**
```rust
pub type Result<T> = std::result::Result<T, SwissArmyHammerError>;
pub type WorkflowResult<T> = std::result::Result<T, WorkflowError>;
```

**Enum-Based State Modeling**
- Comprehensive enum hierarchies: `SwissArmyHammerError`, `WorkflowRunStatus`
- `#[non_exhaustive]` for future extensibility
- Structured enum variants with named fields

## Async/Sync Hybrid Architecture

**Strategic Async Usage**
- Async for I/O operations: file reading, MCP communication, network requests
- Sync for CPU-bound operations: template rendering, validation, parsing
- `#[tokio::main]` for main entry point, `#[tokio::test]` for async tests

**Concurrent Data Structures**
- `DashMap` for thread-safe caching
- `Arc<Mutex<T>>` for shared mutable state
- `std::sync::OnceLock` for global configuration

## Memory Management Patterns

**Smart Pointer Usage**
- `Arc<T>` for shared ownership (storage backends, libraries)
- `Box<dyn Error>` for error trait objects
- `Cow<str>` for flexible string handling

**Resource Management**
- RAII pattern for file handles and processes
- Custom `Drop` implementations for cleanup (ProcessGuard, TestHomeGuard)
- Temporary file management with `tempfile` crate

## Generic Programming

**Trait-Based Architecture**
```rust
pub trait StorageBackend: Send + Sync {
    fn store(&mut self, prompt: Prompt) -> Result<()>;
    fn get(&self, name: &str) -> Result<Prompt>;
    // ... with default implementations
}
```

**Plugin System**
- Dynamic loading through trait objects
- Registry pattern for filter registration
- Extensible architecture through trait implementations

## Error Handling Philosophy

**Comprehensive Error Types**
- Domain-specific error variants
- Error chaining with `#[source]` annotations
- Context preservation through custom `ErrorContext` trait

**Graceful Degradation**
- Non-fatal errors logged but don't crash application
- Fallback mechanisms for missing resources
- Clear distinction between recoverable and non-recoverable errors

This codebase demonstrates mature Rust practices with emphasis on safety, performance, and maintainability through careful use of the type system and ownership model.
