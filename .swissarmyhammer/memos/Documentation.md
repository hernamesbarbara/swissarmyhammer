- Do not overdo it on examples:
  - do not create shell script examples
  - do create simple workflows with mermaid
  - do create simple prompts with liquid
  - do link to builtin prompts rather than create new examples -- this way we know they are tested and work
- Do not assume or dictate usage scenarions, i.e. 'solo developer' or 'enterprise' -- there is no way you actually know this
