# File Tools Security and Validation Framework

Refer to /Users/wballard/github/sah-filetools/ideas/tools.md

## Objective
Implement comprehensive security validation for file system operations to ensure safe access within workspace boundaries.

## Tasks
- [ ] Implement `FilePathValidator` with workspace boundary validation
- [ ] Create path normalization utilities to handle relative paths and symlinks
- [ ] Implement file type detection and validation
- [ ] Add permission checking utilities
- [ ] Create secure file access wrappers
- [ ] Implement protection against path traversal attacks
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling for security violations

## Security Requirements
- All file paths must be absolute and within workspace boundaries
- Path normalization to resolve symlinks and relative references
- Validation against attempting to access system files outside workspace
- Permission verification before file operations
- Protection against malicious path patterns (../, etc.)

## Implementation Components
```rust
// In files/shared_utils.rs
pub struct FilePathValidator;
pub struct SecureFileAccess;
pub enum FileAccessError;

// Key functions
- validate_absolute_path(path: &Path) -> Result<PathBuf>
- ensure_workspace_boundary(path: &Path) -> Result<()>
- check_file_permissions(path: &Path, operation: FileOperation) -> Result<()>
- normalize_and_validate_path(path: &str) -> Result<PathBuf>
```

## Test Coverage
- [ ] Path traversal attack prevention
- [ ] Workspace boundary enforcement  
- [ ] Permission validation
- [ ] Malformed path handling
- [ ] Symlink resolution security

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All security validation functions implemented and tested
- [ ] Comprehensive unit tests for security scenarios
- [ ] Integration with existing error handling patterns
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities in path handling
- [ ] Performance benchmarks for validation overhead
