# Implement Comprehensive Error Handling and Security

## Overview
Add robust error handling for all failure scenarios and implement basic security controls to prevent SSRF and other web-based attacks. Refer to /Users/wballard/github/sah-fetch/ideas/fetch.md.

## Tasks
- Implement comprehensive error handling for network, parsing, and security errors
- Add URL scheme validation (HTTP/HTTPS only)
- Implement content size limits with graceful truncation
- Add basic domain validation and blacklist support
- Map markdowndown errors to MCP-appropriate error responses

## Implementation Details
- Handle network errors: connection refused, timeout, DNS resolution failures
- Handle content errors: malformed HTML, encoding failures, size limits exceeded
- Validate URL schemes and reject non-HTTP/HTTPS URLs
- Implement content size limits with truncation warnings
- Create structured error responses matching specification format
- Add security logging for suspicious requests

## Success Criteria
- All error conditions are handled gracefully
- Error responses match specification format
- URL validation prevents non-HTTP schemes
- Content size limits are enforced
- Security events are logged appropriately
- Clear error messages help debugging

## Dependencies
- Requires fetch_000006_redirect-handling (for complete functionality)

## Estimated Impact
- Ensures tool reliability under error conditions
- Provides basic security protections
