# Create Integration Tests for Notify Tool

Refer to /Users/wballard/github/swissarmyhammer/ideas/notify_tool.md

## Objective
Create integration tests that verify the notify tool works correctly through the MCP protocol and integrates properly with the overall system.

## Tasks
1. Create integration test file in appropriate test directory
2. Test tool execution through MCP protocol
3. Verify logging output with correct target
4. Test tool registration and discovery
5. Test error handling through MCP interface
6. Verify structured context handling in real scenarios

## Integration Test Requirements

### MCP Protocol Tests
- Test tool discovery through MCP tools list
- Test tool execution via MCP call interface
- Verify request/response handling through protocol
- Test parameter validation through MCP layer
- Ensure proper error propagation through MCP

### Logging Integration Tests
- Verify logging appears with "llm_notify" target
- Test log level filtering capabilities
- Confirm structured context appears in logs
- Test concurrent logging from multiple tool calls

### System Integration Tests
- Test tool registry integration
- Verify tool doesn't interfere with existing tools
- Test resource cleanup after tool execution
- Verify thread safety of logging operations

### End-to-End Scenarios
- Test realistic notification scenarios
- Verify logging output in various contexts
- Test error recovery and handling
- Validate performance under load

## Implementation Notes
- Use existing integration test patterns from other tools
- Include proper test environment setup
- Use real logging capture for verification
- Follow established async test patterns
- Include both positive and negative test cases

## Success Criteria
- Tool executes correctly through MCP protocol
- Logging integration works as specified
- Tool registration and discovery function properly
- Error handling works through all layers
- Integration tests pass consistently

## Dependencies
- Build on unit tests from step 000007
