# PLAN_000004: Flow Integration Analysis

**Refer to ./specification/plan.md**

## Goal

Analyze the flow execution system in `swissarmyhammer-cli/src/flow.rs` to understand how to properly integrate the new plan command with the existing workflow execution infrastructure.

## Background

Before implementing the command handler, we need to understand how the existing flow system works, particularly how commands are mapped to workflow executions and how parameters are passed from CLI to workflows.

## Requirements

1. Examine `swissarmyhammer-cli/src/flow.rs` for execution patterns
2. Understand how other CLI commands trigger workflow execution
3. Identify the function signature for workflow execution
4. Document parameter passing mechanisms
5. Understand error handling patterns
6. Identify where to add the Plan command handler

## Investigation Tasks

### 1. Flow Execution Analysis

- Read `swissarmyhammer-cli/src/flow.rs` completely
- Identify main workflow execution function
- Document function signature and parameters
- Understand how variables are passed to workflows

### 2. Existing Command Handler Patterns

- Find examples of CLI commands that execute workflows
- Document the pattern used for parameter passing
- Identify error handling approaches
- Understand return value handling

### 3. Variable Passing System

- Understand how CLI arguments become workflow variables
- Document the format for variable passing (Vec<(String, String)>?)
- Identify any validation or transformation logic
- Check for templating variable support

### 4. Integration Points

- Identify where command handlers are typically placed
- Find the main command router/dispatcher
- Understand the async execution pattern
- Document any common imports or dependencies needed

## Expected Findings

Based on the specification, we expect to find:

```rust
// Expected function signature (to be confirmed)
execute_workflow(
    workflow_name: &str, 
    vars: Vec<(String, String)>, 
    // ... other parameters
) -> Result<(), Error>
```

And usage pattern like:

```rust
Commands::Plan { plan_filename } => {
    let vars = vec![
        ("plan_filename".to_string(), plan_filename.clone())
    ];
    
    execute_workflow("plan", vars, /* other args */).await?;
}
```

## Implementation Steps

1. Read and analyze `swissarmyhammer-cli/src/flow.rs`
2. Look for the main command handling logic (likely in `main.rs` or similar)
3. Document the workflow execution function signature
4. Find examples of other command handlers
5. Create documentation of integration patterns
6. Prepare implementation plan for PLAN_000005

## Deliverables

1. Complete analysis of flow execution system
2. Documented function signatures and patterns  
3. Example code from existing command handlers
4. Clear implementation plan for Plan command handler
5. Understanding of error handling requirements

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Flow execution system fully understood
- [ ] Workflow execution function identified and documented
- [ ] Parameter passing mechanism documented
- [ ] Existing command handler patterns identified
- [ ] Error handling approach understood
- [ ] Clear path forward for implementation identified

## Dependencies

- Requires understanding from previous steps
- Foundation for PLAN_000005 implementation

## Notes

- This is an analysis step, not implementation
- Document findings thoroughly for next step
- Look for async/await patterns
- Pay attention to error types and handling
- Identify any logging or debug patterns to follow
