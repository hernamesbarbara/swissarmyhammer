create_work_branch needs to return a ABORT ERROR rather than branch from an issue branch.

create_work_branch should only branch from main or find that it is already on the correct issue branch such as resuming from a crash

We need to make sure ABORT ERROR in a response exits all the way out cancelling now matter now many nested workflows, prompts, or tools we are deep.

## Proposed Solution

I will implement the following changes:

1. **Modify `create_work_branch` in `swissarmyhammer/src/git.rs`:**
   - Check current branch before creating new branch
   - If already on correct issue branch, return success immediately  
   - If on main branch, create new issue branch as before
   - If on any other issue branch, return "ABORT ERROR" immediately

2. **Update error handling in MCP tool handlers:**
   - Detect "ABORT ERROR" responses and propagate them up
   - Ensure ABORT ERROR terminates nested execution flows

3. **Add comprehensive tests:**
   - Test creating branch from main (success)
   - Test resuming on correct issue branch (success) 
   - Test attempting to branch from wrong issue branch (ABORT ERROR)

The key insight is that `create_work_branch` currently uses `git checkout -b` from whatever branch you're on, but should only allow branching from main or detect resuming from the correct issue branch.
