The whole ideas of IssueNumber is just wrong, issue should just have an IssueName that is a string
derived from the file name -- such as

<issue_name>.md

When we create issues, we need to create them with <nnnnnn>.md so they sort nicely, but
human user will drop in issues with ANY NAME .md that they like.

We will always execute the issues in lexicographical order, the <nnnnnn> is just a way to
establish ordering when we use `issue create`.

We cannot assume that every issue will have a unique <nnnnnn> for example, 

000001_part_a.md
000001_part_b.md

is perfectly valid

## Proposed Solution

I need to refactor the issue handling system to use IssueName (derived from filename) as the primary identifier instead of IssueNumber:

### Key Changes:

1. **Update Core Data Structures**:
   - Modify `Issue` struct to use `IssueName` as primary identifier
   - Remove `IssueNumber` from main Issue struct 
   - Add filename parsing logic to extract name from any `.md` file

2. **Update IssueStorage Trait**:
   - Change method signatures from `number: u32` to `name: IssueName`
   - Update `get_issue(name: IssueName)`, `update_issue(name: IssueName)`, etc.
   - Modify `create_issue` to generate filenames based on lexicographical ordering

3. **Filename Handling**:
   - Support both formats: `<nnnnnn>_<name>.md` and `<arbitrary_name>.md`
   - Use lexicographical ordering for execution (numbered files sort before named files)
   - Extract issue name from filename without extension
   - For numbered format: extract name part after first underscore
   - For arbitrary format: use entire filename (without .md) as name

4. **Update MCP Types**:
   - Change request/response types to use `IssueName` instead of `IssueNumber`
   - Update API contracts and error messages

5. **Maintain Backward Compatibility**:
   - Keep ability to create `<nnnnnn>_name.md` format for ordering
   - Support existing numbered files during migration
   - Ensure tests still pass

### Implementation Steps:
1. Update filesystem.rs Issue struct and related functions
2. Update IssueStorage trait method signatures  
3. Update MCP request/response types
4. Update all callers to use IssueName instead of IssueNumber
5. Update tests to verify filename-based identification works
6. Ensure lexicographical ordering functions correctly
