The whole ideas of IssueNumber is just wrong, issue should just have an IssueName that is a string
derived from the file name -- such as

<issue_name>.md

When we create issues, we need to create them with <nnnnnn>.md so they sort nicely, but
human user will drop in issues with ANY NAME .md that they like.

We will always execute the issues in lexicographical order, the <nnnnnn> is just a way to
establish ordering when we use `issue create`.

We cannot assume that every issue will have a unique <nnnnnn> for example, 

000001_part_a.md
000001_part_b.md

is perfectly valid
