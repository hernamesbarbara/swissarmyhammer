# Add Security and Edge Case Testing

## Overview
Implement comprehensive security testing and edge case handling to ensure the web_fetch tool is resistant to malicious inputs and handles edge cases gracefully. Refer to /Users/wballard/github/sah-fetch/ideas/fetch.md.

## Tasks
- Add tests for malicious URL patterns and SSRF prevention
- Test handling of extremely large content and memory limits
- Test malformed HTML and encoding edge cases
- Add tests for rate limiting and abuse prevention
- Test SSL/TLS certificate validation scenarios

## Implementation Details
- Test URL validation with malicious patterns (localhost, private IPs, etc.)
- Test content size limits with large responses
- Test malformed HTML, broken encoding, and edge case content
- Create scenarios for timeout handling and partial content
- Test SSL certificate validation with expired/invalid certificates
- Test concurrent request handling and rate limiting
- Use security-focused test patterns

## Success Criteria
- Malicious URLs are properly rejected
- Large content is handled without memory issues
- Malformed content doesn't cause crashes
- SSL validation works correctly
- Rate limiting prevents abuse
- Security logging captures suspicious activity

## Dependencies
- Requires fetch_000011_tool-registration (for complete functionality)

## Estimated Impact
- Ensures tool security and reliability
- Prevents potential security vulnerabilities
