# Final Validation and Code Cleanup

Refer to /Users/wballard/github/swissarmyhammer/ideas/notify_tool.md

## Objective
Perform final validation, cleanup, and ensure the notify tool implementation meets all specification requirements and follows codebase standards.

## Tasks
1. Run all tests and ensure they pass
2. Perform code formatting with `cargo fmt`
3. Run clippy and fix any warnings
4. Validate against specification requirements
5. Perform final code review and cleanup
6. Test end-to-end functionality

## Validation Checklist

### Specification Compliance
- ✅ Tool name is "notify"
- ✅ Parameters match specification (message, level, context)
- ✅ Logging uses "llm_notify" target
- ✅ Level validation (info, warn, error) with fallback
- ✅ Response format matches specification
- ✅ Error handling as specified

### Code Quality
- ✅ Code formatting with `cargo fmt`
- ✅ No clippy warnings
- ✅ Proper documentation and comments
- ✅ Follows established patterns
- ✅ Thread-safe implementation
- ✅ Proper error handling

### Testing
- ✅ Unit tests pass
- ✅ Integration tests pass
- ✅ Code coverage adequate
- ✅ Error scenarios tested
- ✅ Performance acceptable

### Integration
- ✅ Tool registry integration works
- ✅ MCP protocol compatibility
- ✅ No existing functionality broken
- ✅ Documentation complete

## Final Verification Steps
1. Build entire project successfully
2. Run complete test suite
3. Manually test tool through MCP interface
4. Verify logging output in various scenarios
5. Check integration with existing tools
