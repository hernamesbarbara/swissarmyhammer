# Step 149: Implement Issue File System Operations (Create and Read)

## Goal
Implement the core file system operations for creating and reading issues from the `./issues` directory, including proper file naming and content handling.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Implement FileSystemIssueStorage
In `swissarmyhammer/src/issues.rs`:

```rust
pub struct FileSystemIssueStorage {
    state: IssueState,
}

impl FileSystemIssueStorage {
    /// Create a new file system based issue storage
    pub fn new() -> Result<Self> {
        let issues_dir = PathBuf::from("./issues");
        let completed_dir = issues_dir.join("complete");
        
        // Create directories if they don't exist
        std::fs::create_dir_all(&issues_dir)?;
        std::fs::create_dir_all(&completed_dir)?;
        
        Ok(Self {
            state: IssueState {
                issues_dir,
                completed_dir,
            },
        })
    }
}
```

### 2. Implement Issue Reading Functions

```rust
impl FileSystemIssueStorage {
    /// Parse issue from file path
    fn parse_issue_from_file(&self, path: &Path) -> Result<Issue> {
        // Extract number and name from filename
        // Format: <nnnnnn>_<name>.md
        let filename = path.file_stem()
            .ok_or_else(|| /* error */)?
            .to_str()
            .ok_or_else(|| /* error */)?;
        
        // Parse the 6-digit number
        // Extract the name part
        // Read file content
        // Determine if completed based on path
        
        Ok(Issue { /* fields */ })
    }
    
    /// List issues in a directory
    fn list_issues_in_dir(&self, dir: &Path) -> Result<Vec<Issue>> {
        // Read all .md files in directory
        // Parse each into an Issue
        // Sort by number
    }
}
```

### 3. Implement Create Operation

```rust
impl FileSystemIssueStorage {
    /// Get the next available issue number
    fn get_next_issue_number(&self) -> Result<u32> {
        // List all issues (pending and completed)
        // Find highest number
        // Return highest + 1 (or 1 if no issues)
    }
    
    /// Create issue file
    fn create_issue_file(&self, number: u32, name: &str, content: &str) -> Result<PathBuf> {
        // Format filename as <nnnnnn>_<name>.md
        // Ensure name is filesystem-safe
        // Write content to file
        // Return full path
    }
}
```

### 4. Implement IssueStorage Trait
```rust
impl IssueStorage for FileSystemIssueStorage {
    async fn list_issues(&self) -> Result<Vec<Issue>> {
        // List from both pending and completed directories
        // Combine and sort by number
    }
    
    async fn get_issue(&self, number: u32) -> Result<Issue> {
        // Check pending directory first
        // Then check completed directory
        // Return IssueNotFound if not found
    }
    
    async fn create_issue(&self, name: String, content: String) -> Result<Issue> {
        // Get next number
        // Create file
        // Return Issue struct
    }
}
```

## Testing
- Test creating issues with various names (including special characters)
- Test reading issues from filesystem
- Test listing issues from both directories
- Test proper number sequencing
- Test error cases (missing files, invalid formats)

## Success Criteria
- Can create new issues with auto-incrementing numbers
- Can read existing issues from filesystem
- Proper error handling for edge cases
- All tests pass

## Proposed Solution

I will implement the file system operations for issue management by:

1. **Updating the constructor** to create directories if they don't exist
2. **Implementing file parsing** to extract issue number and name from filenames (format: `<nnnnnn>_<name>.md`)
3. **Adding directory listing** functionality to read all issues from both pending and complete directories
4. **Creating auto-incrementing logic** to find the next available issue number
5. **Implementing file creation** with proper naming and content handling
6. **Completing the IssueStorage trait** with all required async methods

The implementation will follow the existing error handling patterns using the `SwissArmyHammerError` types and will include comprehensive tests for all functionality.
