Workflow and Prompt loading is similar in that it is a stack of directory overrides.

Combine all file loading of the .swissarmyhammer directories, overriding by name to end up
with a map of path->file.

Use this as a virtual file system to load prompts and workflows rather than direct file access.

The idea is to make sure we load files in the same way across the workflow and prompt features.
