I just created an issue and it did not start with six digit number higher than any other six digit number.

When we create an issue with mcp, or cli -- it needs that 6 digit prefix. users can name files whatever they like, but this program needs to create a next highest 6 digit prefix higher than any number anywhere in the issues folder or complete.
