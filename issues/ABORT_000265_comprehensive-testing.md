# Implement Comprehensive Testing for New Abort System

Refer to ./specification/abort.md

## Objective
Create comprehensive test coverage for the new file-based abort system, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end validation to ensure the system works correctly and maintains existing behavior.

## Context
The new abort system replaces critical functionality that must work reliably. Comprehensive testing ensures the file-based approach works correctly across all components and scenarios, and provides regression protection.

## Tasks

### 1. Unit Tests for Abort Tool
Create tests for the MCP abort tool:
- Test abort file creation with various reasons
- Test atomic file operations
- Test error handling for file system failures
- Test concurrent access scenarios
- Test directory creation when needed

### 2. WorkflowRun Cleanup Tests
Test the abort file cleanup functionality:
- Test cleanup when abort file exists
- Test cleanup when no abort file exists
- Test cleanup with file system permission errors
- Test that workflow initialization succeeds despite cleanup failures

### 3. Executor Integration Tests
Test abort detection in workflow executor:
- Test abort file detection during workflow execution
- Test immediate termination when abort file is found
- Test abort reason propagation through error system
- Test performance impact of abort checking

### 4. CLI Integration Tests
Test CLI handling of new abort system:
- Test CLI response to ExecutorError::Abort
- Test proper exit codes for abort conditions
- Test error message formatting with abort reasons
- Test integration with different CLI commands

### 5. End-to-End Abort Flow Tests
Test complete abort scenarios:
- Test abort tool → file creation → executor detection → CLI exit
- Test abort in nested workflows
- Test abort with concurrent workflows
- Test abort file cleanup between runs

### 6. Regression Tests
Ensure existing behavior is maintained:
- Test that normal workflow execution is unaffected
- Test that existing error handling still works
- Test that abort behavior matches previous string-based system
- Test backward compatibility during transition

## Implementation Details

### Test File Organization
```
swissarmyhammer/tests/
├── abort_tool_tests.rs          # Unit tests for MCP tool
├── abort_integration_tests.rs   # Integration tests
├── abort_end_to_end_tests.rs    # End-to-end scenarios
```

### Key Test Scenarios
```rust
#[test]
fn test_abort_tool_creates_file_with_reason() {
    // Test basic abort tool functionality
}

#[test] 
fn test_workflow_cleanup_removes_existing_abort_file() {
    // Test WorkflowRun cleanup
}

#[test]
fn test_executor_detects_abort_file_and_terminates() {
    // Test executor integration
}

#[test]
fn test_end_to_end_abort_flow() {
    // Test complete abort scenario
}
```

### Test Infrastructure
- Use existing test utilities and patterns
- Create helper functions for abort file management
- Use temporary directories for isolated testing
- Mock file system operations where appropriate

### Performance Testing
- Measure overhead of abort file checking in executor loop
- Ensure abort detection doesn't significantly impact performance
- Test with various workflow sizes and complexities

## Validation Criteria
- [ ] Unit tests cover all abort tool functionality
- [ ] Integration tests cover component interactions
- [ ] End-to-end tests cover complete abort scenarios
- [ ] Regression tests ensure existing behavior is preserved
- [ ] Performance tests show acceptable overhead
- [ ] Test coverage meets project standards
- [ ] All tests pass consistently
- [ ] Tests provide clear failure messages

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Test Coverage
- Abort tool parameter validation
- File creation and atomic operations
- Error handling for various failure modes
- Cleanup logic in WorkflowRun
- Executor abort detection

### Integration Test Coverage
- Tool registration and MCP protocol integration
- Error propagation through executor system
- CLI error handling and exit codes
- Prompt usage of abort tool

### End-to-End Test Coverage
- Complete abort workflow from tool to CLI exit
- Multiple workflow scenarios
- Concurrent execution scenarios
- Error recovery scenarios
