This is incorrect behavior:

```
Ôê≤ cargo run search query "duckdb" 
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.19s
     Running `target/debug/swissarmyhammer search query duckdb`

```

when running search or index at the root of a repository, this case swissarmyhammer itself, the semantic db was created in my home directory.

i already gave you an issue about this, I really mean it -- the semantic db should NEVER be in the user home directory, it ONLY should be in a .swissarmyhammer directory in a local repository

Last time you didn't even make a plan or try: /Users/wballard/github/swissarmyhammer/issues/complete/01K13M176K23E2CRRSFYEYV4WM.md

THINK. Fix this!
