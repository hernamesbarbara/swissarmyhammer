Speed up these slow tests to be less than 10s.

        SLOW [>120.000s] swissarmyhammer-cli::e2e_workflow_tests test_complete_search_workflow

        PASS [  19.207s] swissarmyhammer-cli::bin/swissarmyhammer search::tests::test_run_semantic_index_multiple_patterns

You will probably need to test less, and make multiple tests to do this.

## Proposed Solution

After analyzing the test files, I've identified the main causes of the slow tests:

1. **`test_complete_search_workflow` (>120s)**: This test is trying to download and initialize ML models for semantic search, which is extremely slow and unreliable in test environments.

2. **`test_run_semantic_index_multiple_patterns` (19s, 15s)**: These are doing real semantic indexing with ML model initialization, which is also slow.

### Root Causes:
- ML model downloads in test environment (fastembed models ~100MB)  
- Real semantic indexing operations on multiple files
- Network dependencies that can hang indefinitely
- Model initialization overhead

### Solution Strategy:
1. **Break up the large `test_complete_search_workflow` into smaller, focused tests**
2. **Mock/skip semantic search operations in test environment** 
3. **Use environment detection to run fast mode by default**
4. **Create lightweight unit tests that test individual components**
5. **Implement proper timeouts and fallbacks**

The tests should be restructured to:
- Test CLI argument parsing and command structure (fast)
- Test basic file operations without ML models (fast) 
- Test MCP integration with mocked responses (fast)
- Use `#[ignore]` for tests requiring actual ML model downloads
- Add fast-path alternatives that verify functionality without heavy operations

This will get all tests under 10s while maintaining good test coverage.
