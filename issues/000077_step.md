# Step 77: Comprehensive Workflow Integration Testing

## Goal
Create thorough integration tests that verify the workflow system works correctly end-to-end with all components integrated.

## Context
With all workflow components implemented, we need comprehensive tests to ensure they work together correctly.

## Requirements
1. End-to-end test scenarios:
   - Complete workflow execution
   - Resume after interruption
   - Parallel execution
   - Error handling and recovery
   - Nested workflows
2. Integration test infrastructure:
   - Mock Claude API responses
   - Test workflow fixtures
   - Assertion helpers
   - Performance benchmarks
3. Test coverage for:
   - CLI commands
   - Parser edge cases
   - Storage operations
   - Concurrent execution
   - Resource cleanup

## Implementation Notes
- Use test workflows in `tests/workflows/`
- Mock external dependencies
- Test both success and failure paths
- Verify file system state
- Check for resource leaks
- Test interruption scenarios
- Measure execution times

## Success Criteria
- All major features tested
- Tests are reliable and fast
- Good error scenario coverage
- Performance benchmarks pass
- No flaky tests
