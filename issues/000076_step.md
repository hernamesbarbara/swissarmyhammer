# Step 76: Optimize Workflow Performance

## Goal
Implement performance optimizations to ensure workflows execute efficiently, especially for large and complex workflows.

## Context
As workflows grow in complexity, performance becomes critical. We need to optimize parsing, execution, and storage operations.

## Requirements
1. Parsing optimizations:
   - Cache parsed workflows
   - Lazy loading of workflows
   - Parallel workflow loading
   - Optimize pest grammar
2. Execution optimizations:
   - State transition caching
   - Efficient variable context
   - Minimize serialization
   - Async I/O operations
3. Storage optimizations:
   - Efficient run state format
   - Compressed log storage
   - Indexed run queries
   - Cleanup old runs automatically

## Implementation Notes
- Profile current performance
- Identify bottlenecks
- Use benchmarks to measure improvements
- Consider memory usage
- Optimize hot paths
- Lazy load workflow definitions
- Use efficient data structures

## Success Criteria
- Workflow parsing < 100ms
- State transitions < 10ms
- Large workflows perform well
- Memory usage reasonable
- Benchmarks show improvements
