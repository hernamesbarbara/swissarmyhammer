# Shell Action Project Setup

Refer to ./specification/shell.md

## Overview

This is the first step in implementing shell actions for workflows. This step focuses on setting up the project structure and understanding the existing codebase patterns before implementing the shell action functionality.

## Objective

Set up the development environment and understand the existing action system architecture to ensure the shell action implementation follows established patterns.

## Tasks

### 1. Environment Setup
- Ensure the development environment is properly configured
- Run existing tests to confirm the codebase is in a working state
- Review the specification requirements thoroughly

### 2. Codebase Analysis  
- Study the existing action implementations in `swissarmyhammer/src/workflow/actions.rs`
- Analyze the action parser patterns in `swissarmyhammer/src/workflow/action_parser.rs`
- Understand the action dispatch mechanism in `parse_action_from_description`
- Review existing action traits and patterns

### 3. Architecture Planning
- Identify where the `ShellAction` struct should be implemented
- Plan the integration points with the existing parser system
- Design the shell action parameters structure
- Plan the security validation approach

### 4. Testing Strategy
- Review existing action tests to understand testing patterns
- Plan the testing approach for shell actions
- Identify security test requirements
- Plan integration test scenarios

## Expected Deliverables

1. **Development Environment Verification**
   - Confirm all tests pass: `cargo test`
   - Confirm clippy is clean: `cargo clippy`
   - Confirm formatting is correct: `cargo fmt --check`

2. **Architecture Documentation** 
   - Clear understanding of where to implement ShellAction
   - Integration plan with existing systems
   - Security considerations documented

3. **Testing Plan**
   - Unit test strategy for shell actions
   - Integration test approach
   - Security test requirements

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All existing tests pass
- [ ] Clear understanding of action system architecture
- [ ] Solid plan for shell action implementation
- [ ] Testing strategy defined
- [ ] Security considerations identified

## Implementation Notes

This step is purely preparatory and should not involve any code changes. The focus is on understanding and planning to ensure a clean, well-integrated implementation in subsequent steps.

## Next Steps

After completing this setup, proceed to implementing the basic ShellAction struct in the next step.
