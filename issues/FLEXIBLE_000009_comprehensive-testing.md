# Comprehensive Testing for Flexible Base Branch Support

Refer to ./specification/flexible_base_branch_support.md

## Goal

Add comprehensive test coverage for flexible base branch workflows and update existing tests to work with new functionality.

## Tasks

1. **Update Existing Git Operation Tests**
   - Update tests in `swissarmyhammer/src/git.rs` test module (lines 348-797)
   - Modify tests that assume main branch requirement  
   - Add source branch parameters to test calls where needed
   - Ensure backwards compatibility tests still pass

2. **Add Flexible Branching Workflow Tests**
   - Test complete workflow: feature branch → issue branch → merge back to feature branch
   - Test release branch workflows  
   - Test multiple issue branches from same source branch
   - Test complex branching scenarios

3. **Add MCP Tool Integration Tests**
   - Test issue work tool with various source branches
   - Test issue merge tool with different target branches
   - Test error conditions and abort tool integration
   - Test backwards compatibility with existing issues

4. **Add Edge Case Testing**
   - Test behavior when source branch is deleted mid-workflow
   - Test merge conflict scenarios with source branch
   - Test validation prevents circular issue branch creation
   - Test error recovery scenarios

5. **Performance and Compatibility Testing**  
   - Test performance with various Git workflow patterns
   - Test compatibility with Git Flow, GitHub Flow, etc.
   - Test with large repositories and many branches
   - Test concurrent issue branch operations

## Implementation Details

- Location: Test files in `swissarmyhammer/src/git.rs`, integration test files, MCP tool tests
- Add new test cases for flexible workflows
- Update existing test cases to use source branch parameters
- Ensure comprehensive coverage of all new functionality

## Testing Requirements

- All existing tests continue to pass (backwards compatibility)
- New flexible workflow tests pass
- Edge cases are tested and handled correctly
- Integration tests verify end-to-end functionality
- Performance tests show acceptable performance
- Compatibility tests work with common Git workflows

## Success Criteria

- Comprehensive test coverage for all flexible branching scenarios
- All existing tests pass with updated implementation
- New functionality is thoroughly tested
- Edge cases and error conditions are covered
- Performance is acceptable for common use cases
- Integration with various Git workflows is verified

This step ensures the flexible branching implementation is robust and reliable through comprehensive testing.
