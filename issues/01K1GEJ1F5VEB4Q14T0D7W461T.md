In this block, if we are already in the target state, delete the issue file that is just under ./issues


```
        // Check if already in target state
        if issue.completed == to_completed {
            debug!("Issue {} already in target state", name);
            return Ok(issue);
        }
```

Research and find why the file did not move into ./issues/complete and fix the root cause too.
