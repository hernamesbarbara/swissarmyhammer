When detecting circular dependencies, only log the first one in `validate`.

Otherwise it is just too noisy.



Example


workflow:tdd
  WARN [-] Circular dependency detected: check -> loop -> test -> check
    ðŸ’¡ Ensure the workflow has proper exit conditions to avoid infinite loops
  WARN [-] Circular dependency detected: test -> check -> loop -> test
    ðŸ’¡ Ensure the workflow has proper exit conditions to avoid infinite loops
  WARN [-] Circular dependency detected: test -> check -> loop -> test
    ðŸ’¡ Ensure the workflow has proper exit conditions to avoid infinite loops
  WARN [-] Circular dependency detected: test -> check -> loop -> test
    ðŸ’¡ Ensure the workflow has proper exit conditions to avoid infinite loops



should be

workflow:tdd
  WARN [-] Circular dependency detected: check -> loop -> test -> check
    ðŸ’¡ Ensure the workflow has proper exit conditions to avoid infinite loops
