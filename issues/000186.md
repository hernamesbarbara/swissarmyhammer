 when you see ABORT ERROR in a prompt or workflow response, no fooling, you need to abort.

 this means abort, not just carry on as if nothing happened -- we need a nice clean abort where
 workflows, prompts etc stop, we log an error, and full on exit swissarmyhammer with a non zero exit code

## Proposed Solution

I will implement abort error handling by:

1. **Create a helper function** to scan output text for "ABORT ERROR" pattern and return an `ActionError::AbortError` if found
2. **Modify prompt rendering output** in `swissarmyhammer-cli/src/test.rs` to check for "ABORT ERROR" in the rendered prompt and abort execution if found
3. **Modify workflow action execution** in `swissarmyhammer/src/workflow/actions.rs` to check action outputs for "ABORT ERROR" and trigger abort
4. **Update main CLI exit handling** in `swissarmyhammer-cli/src/main.rs` to properly handle abort errors with non-zero exit code
5. **Add comprehensive tests** to verify abort handling works correctly for both prompts and workflows

The implementation will use the existing `ActionError::AbortError` variant that's already defined in the codebase and ensure clean shutdown with proper logging and non-zero exit codes.
