# Remove Debug Print Statements from Search Storage Module

## Location
`swissarmyhammer/src/search/storage.rs:1490-1497`

## Description
Debug println statements are present in production code for error troubleshooting. These should be removed or replaced with proper logging using the `tracing` crate.

## Current State
The code contains raw `println!` statements used for debugging purposes that should not be in production code.

## Requirements
- Remove all debug `println!` statements
- Replace with proper logging using the `tracing` crate if logging is needed
- Ensure no debug output goes to stdout in production
- Follow Rust coding standards for logging

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All debug `println!` statements removed
- [ ] If logging is needed, `tracing` crate is used instead
- [ ] No console output in normal operation
- [ ] Appropriate log levels used (debug, trace, etc.)
- [ ] Code follows Rust best practices for error handling and logging
