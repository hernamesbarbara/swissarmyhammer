# Step 72: Add Conditional Transitions and Choice States

## Goal
Implement support for conditional transitions and choice states to enable dynamic workflow paths based on runtime conditions.

## Context
Workflows need to make decisions based on data and execution results. This requires evaluating conditions and supporting choice states.

## Requirements

1. Implement condition evaluation engine:
   - https://github.com/clarkmcc/cel-rust
   - define a `result` variable with the output text from the final response json from claude
   - define a `default` variable that is == `true`
2. Add choice state support:
   ```mermaid
   stateDiagram-v2
       state CheckResult <<choice>>
       Process --> CheckResult
       CheckResult --> Success: result == "ok"
       CheckResult --> Failed: default
   ```
3. Transition conditions:
   - Evaluate in order
   - First matching condition wins
   - Support default transitions

## Implementation Notes
- Use simple expression parser
- Variables from workflow context
- Type coercion for comparisons
- Null-safe operations
- Clear error messages for invalid expressions
- Cache parsed expressions

## Success Criteria
- Condition evaluation works correctly
- Choice states route properly
- Complex conditions supported
- Good error messages
- Performance acceptable
