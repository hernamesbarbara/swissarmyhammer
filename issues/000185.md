You made things too hard -- numbered and named issues are -- just the same:

use entire filename (without .md) as name

don't make a distinction about there being a number -- the number is *just a convention* to force ordering of files

so file to issue name goes like this

000001_paper.md --> 000001_paper
nice.md --> nice
000001.md --> 000001

i.e. -- just strip off the amned .md and don't make this convoluted


make a pass through all the code and verify that there is *only one* spot where we are processing issue file name parsing and issue file system iteration -- eliminate code duplication to make sure we have one tested path
