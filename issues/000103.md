Partials do not require front matter.

Make sure that validate doesn't report front matter missing errors in this case.

Example:

review_format.md
  ERROR [-] Missing required field: title
    ðŸ’¡ Add a title field to the YAML front matter
  ERROR [-] Missing required field: description
    ðŸ’¡ Add a description field to the YAML front matter
  ERROR [-] Undefined template variable: 'component_type'
    ðŸ’¡ Add 'component_type' to the arguments list or remove the template variable
  ERROR [-] Missing required field: title
    ðŸ’¡ Add a title field to the YAML front matter
  ERROR [-] Missing required field: description
    ðŸ’¡ Add a description field to the YAML front matter
  ERROR [-] Missing required field: title
    ðŸ’¡ Add a title field to the YAML front matter
  ERROR [-] Missing required field: description
    ðŸ’¡ Add a description field to the YAML front matter
  WARN [-] Unused argument: 'language'
    ðŸ’¡ Remove 'language' from arguments or use it in the template


This is wrong in that

- it is checking frontmatter in a partial
- title and description are appearing multiple times, but we only have one file name, so grouping by file isn't happening correctly
