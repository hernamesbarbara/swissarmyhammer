sah issue needs a `next` command to show what will be next

and it needs to do this the exact same wap as mpc issue_next without duplicating logic

in fact all the cli issue commands need to work the same as the MCP, using the same code path, and just format the results nice

DO NOT reimplement logic in the CLI
