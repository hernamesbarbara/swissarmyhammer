Think deeply about what is in cli, but should be moved down to the library.

In general, minimize what is in the cli other than taking input, and formatting output.

## Proposed Solution

After analyzing the codebase, I've identified several areas where business logic in the CLI should be moved to the library:

### 1. **Prompt Filtering Logic** (from `list.rs`)
   - Move filtering by source, category, and search terms to the library
   - Add methods to `PromptLibrary` or create a new `PromptFilter` struct:
     - `filter_by_source(source: PromptSource) -> Vec<Prompt>`
     - `filter_by_category(category: &str) -> Vec<Prompt>`
     - `filter_by_search_term(term: &str) -> Vec<Prompt>`

### 2. **Advanced Search Logic** (from `search.rs`)
   - Move regex, fuzzy matching, and scoring logic to the library's search module
   - Enhance `SearchEngine` with:
     - Regex search support
     - Fuzzy matching with scoring
     - Case-sensitive/insensitive search options
     - Excerpt generation with highlighting
     - Argument-based filtering (has_arg, no_args)

### 3. **Prompt Rendering with Environment Variables** (from `test.rs`)
   - Move the environment variable support for template rendering to the library
   - Add to `Template` or `TemplateEngine`:
     - `render_with_env(args: &HashMap<String, String>) -> Result<String>`
     - Interactive argument collection logic (as a utility)

### 4. **Validation Framework** (from `validate.rs`)
   - Move the content validation framework to the library
   - Create a validation module with:
     - `ContentValidator` trait
     - Built-in validators (encoding, YAML, liquid template, etc.)
     - `ValidationResult` and `ValidationIssue` structs
     - Workflow validation logic

### 5. **Workflow Execution Utilities** (from `flow.rs`)
   - Move common workflow execution patterns to the library
   - Add to workflow module:
     - Variable parsing utilities
     - Interactive variable collection
     - Execution timeout handling
     - Test mode execution support

### Implementation Steps:
1. Create tests in the library for each piece of functionality to be moved
2. Implement the functionality in the library
3. Update CLI modules to use the library functionality
4. Remove duplicated code from CLI
5. Update existing CLI tests to verify integration
