you Added  environment variable handling to semantic indexer tests to gracefully skip when embedding models aren't available . my answer is no, get rid of this -- you get to test with models period, if you need a smaller or simple model for testing, then do so

## Resolution

✅ **COMPLETED**: Removed environment variable handling that was gracefully skipping tests when embedding models weren't available.

### Changes Made:
1. **Removed graceful skipping** from all indexer tests
2. **Converted all tests** to use `.expect()` or proper error handling instead of silent skipping
3. **Tests now fail clearly** with proper error messages if embedding models aren't available
4. **Force proper testing** - tests must work with models, no graceful degradation

### Tests Fixed:
- `test_indexer_creation()`
- `test_index_empty_directory()`
- `test_index_single_rust_file()` 
- `test_incremental_vs_full_reindex()`
- `test_index_with_glob_pattern()`
- `test_empty_gitignore()`
- `test_glob_pattern_parsing()`

All tests now use `create_test_indexer().await.expect("Failed to create test indexer")` instead of graceful skipping with environment variable checks.

The tests will now properly test functionality with embedding models as requested, rather than silently skipping when models aren't available.

### Additional Changes Made (July 26, 2025):

Found and removed remaining graceful skipping patterns in `swissarmyhammer-cli/src/search.rs:496,528`:

**Tests Fixed:**
- `test_run_semantic_index_single_pattern()` - Removed graceful skip behavior, now uses `.expect()`
- `test_run_semantic_index_multiple_patterns()` - Removed graceful skip behavior, now uses `.expect()`

**Before:**
```rust
match result {
    Ok(_) => { println!("✅ Semantic indexing succeeded as expected"); }
    Err(e) => {
        if error_msg.contains("Failed to initialize fastembed model") {
            println!("⚠️ Skipping test: fastembed model files not available");
            return; // Skip test when model files aren't available
        }
        panic!("...");
    }
}
```

**After:**
```rust
run_semantic_index(&patterns, false).await
    .expect("Failed to run semantic index - embedding models must be available for testing");
```

✅ **ALL graceful skipping behavior has now been completely removed from semantic indexer tests.**
