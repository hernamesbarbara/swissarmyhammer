When doing `issue list` I see

ðŸ”„ Active #000000 - 01K0Q4V1N0V35TQEDPXPE1HF7Z (2025-07-21)

that #000000 - still looks like we have an issue number, when the 01K0Q4V1N0V35TQEDPXPE1HF7Z
 is the name.

 There * is no issue number any more * we deleted it in a prior issue, but apparently didn't share code with the CLI.

Triple check all the code and get rid of issue number.
