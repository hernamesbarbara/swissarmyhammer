# Re-enable Memo Performance Test

## Location
`swissarmyhammer-cli/tests/memo_cli_tests.rs:868`

## Description
A performance test for the memo module is currently disabled with `#[ignore]` annotation. This test should be fixed and re-enabled to ensure performance requirements are met.

## Current State
The test is marked with `#[ignore]` preventing it from running in regular test suites.

## Requirements
- Investigate why the performance test was disabled
- Fix any underlying issues causing test failures or inconsistencies
- Ensure the test runs in a reasonable time (< 10s per coding standards)
- Re-enable the test
- Add appropriate performance benchmarks if needed

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Root cause of test being disabled identified
- [ ] Test fixed to run reliably
- [ ] Test completes in under 10 seconds
- [ ] `#[ignore]` attribute removed
- [ ] Test passes consistently in CI/CD
- [ ] Performance metrics documented if applicable
