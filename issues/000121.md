When we pipe the prompt to claude:


2025-07-11T16:34:04.216755Z DEBUG swissarmyhammer::workflow::actions: Piping prompt to Claude:
DO NOT run any tools to perform this task:

Please greet {{ name }} in {{ language | default: 'English' }} and provide an English translation. Make it warm and friendly.



This should show the actual post liquid render.


And -- there is a default for that parameter, and I didn't set it that got me an error.

So -- all the variables need to at least be None https://shopify.github.io/liquid/filters/default/ so that | default works
