# Step 64: Implement Workflow Storage and Persistence

## Goal
Create a storage layer for workflows and workflow runs, enabling persistence for resume functionality.

## Context
Workflows need to be stored as files, and workflow run states need to be persisted to enable the resume feature. We'll extend the existing storage abstraction.

## Requirements
1. Create `workflow/storage.rs` module
2. Implement workflow file loading from:
   - `.swissarmyhammer/workflows/*.mermaid`
   - Support same hierarchical loading as prompts
3. Implement workflow run persistence:
   - Save run state to `.swissarmyhammer/runs/<run_id>/`
   - Include current state, variables, history
   - Use JSON for serialization
4. Add methods for:
   - Listing available workflows
   - Loading workflow by name
   - Saving/loading workflow runs
   - Cleaning up old runs

## Implementation Notes
- Reuse existing storage traits where possible
- Follow the same builtin/user/local hierarchy
- Store run metadata: start time, current state, variables
- Consider file locking for concurrent access
- Implement automatic cleanup of old runs (configurable)

## Success Criteria
- Can load workflows from filesystem
- Can persist and restore workflow runs
- Hierarchical loading works correctly
- Unit tests for all storage operations
- Integration with existing storage system
