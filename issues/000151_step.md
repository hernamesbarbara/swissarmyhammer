# Step 151: Add Issue Update and Move Operations

## Goal
Implement operations to update issue content and move issues between pending and completed states, ensuring atomic file operations and proper error handling.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Add Update Operation to IssueStorage Trait

```rust
pub trait IssueStorage: Send + Sync {
    // ... existing methods ...
    
    /// Update an existing issue's content
    async fn update_issue(&self, number: u32, content: String) -> Result<Issue>;
    
    /// Mark an issue as complete (move to complete directory)
    async fn mark_complete(&self, number: u32) -> Result<Issue>;
}
```

### 2. Implement Update Operation

```rust
impl FileSystemIssueStorage {
    /// Update issue content
    async fn update_issue_impl(&self, number: u32, content: String) -> Result<Issue> {
        // Find the issue file (check both directories)
        // Read current issue to preserve metadata
        // Write new content to file
        // Return updated Issue struct
        
        let issue = self.get_issue(number).await?;
        let path = &issue.file_path;
        
        // Atomic write using temp file and rename
        let temp_path = path.with_extension("tmp");
        std::fs::write(&temp_path, &content)?;
        std::fs::rename(&temp_path, path)?;
        
        Ok(Issue {
            content,
            ..issue
        })
    }
}
```

### 3. Implement Move Operation

```rust
impl FileSystemIssueStorage {
    /// Move issue between directories
    async fn move_issue(&self, number: u32, to_completed: bool) -> Result<Issue> {
        // Find current issue
        let mut issue = self.get_issue(number).await?;
        
        // Check if already in target state
        if issue.completed == to_completed {
            return Ok(issue);
        }
        
        // Determine source and target paths
        let target_dir = if to_completed {
            &self.state.completed_dir
        } else {
            &self.state.issues_dir
        };
        
        // Create target path with same filename
        let filename = issue.file_path.file_name()
            .ok_or_else(|| /* error */)?;
        let target_path = target_dir.join(filename);
        
        // Move file atomically
        std::fs::rename(&issue.file_path, &target_path)?;
        
        // Update issue struct
        issue.file_path = target_path;
        issue.completed = to_completed;
        
        Ok(issue)
    }
}
```

### 4. Implement IssueStorage Methods

```rust
impl IssueStorage for FileSystemIssueStorage {
    async fn update_issue(&self, number: u32, content: String) -> Result<Issue> {
        self.update_issue_impl(number, content).await
    }
    
    async fn mark_complete(&self, number: u32) -> Result<Issue> {
        self.move_issue(number, true).await
    }
}
```

### 5. Add Helper Method for Checking Completion Status

```rust
impl FileSystemIssueStorage {
    /// Check if all issues are completed
    pub async fn all_complete(&self) -> Result<bool> {
        let pending_count = self.list_issues_in_dir(&self.state.issues_dir)?
            .into_iter()
            .filter(|issue| !issue.completed)
            .count();
        
        Ok(pending_count == 0)
    }
}
```

## Error Handling
- Handle file not found gracefully
- Handle permission errors
- Ensure atomic operations (no partial states)
- Rollback on failure where possible

## Testing
- Test updating issue content
- Test moving issue to completed
- Test moving already completed issue (should be no-op)
- Test concurrent access scenarios
- Test error cases (missing files, permission errors)
- Test all_complete with various states

## Success Criteria
- Issues can be updated without data loss
- Issues can be moved between states atomically
- Proper error handling for edge cases
- No race conditions in file operations

## Proposed Solution

I will implement the missing update and move operations for the issue storage system using Test Driven Development:

### 1. Extend IssueStorage Trait
- Add `update_issue(&self, number: u32, content: String) -> Result<Issue>` method
- Add `mark_complete(&self, number: u32) -> Result<Issue>` method

### 2. Implement Update Operation in FileSystemIssueStorage
- Find the issue file using existing `get_issue` method
- Use atomic write operations (temp file + rename) to avoid data corruption
- Preserve all existing issue metadata while updating content

### 3. Implement Move Operation in FileSystemIssueStorage
- Check if issue is already in target state (no-op if already complete)
- Move file atomically between `issues_dir` and `completed_dir` using `std::fs::rename`
- Update issue struct with new path and completed status

### 4. Add Helper Method
- Implement `all_complete()` method to check if all issues are completed
- Scan only the pending issues directory for efficiency

### 5. Add Comprehensive Tests
- Test update operations with various content types
- Test move operations for both directions
- Test error handling for missing files and permission issues
- Test atomic operations under concurrent access
- Test edge cases like empty content and large files

### Implementation Strategy
1. Write failing tests first (TDD approach)
2. Implement trait methods
3. Implement storage methods with atomic operations
4. Add helper method
5. Ensure all tests pass
6. Run existing tests to ensure no regressions
