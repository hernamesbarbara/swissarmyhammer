# Performance Optimization and Memory Management

## Overview
Optimize the web_fetch tool for performance and memory efficiency, ensuring it can handle typical web content sizes efficiently and doesn't consume excessive resources. Refer to /Users/wballard/github/sah-fetch/ideas/fetch.md.

## Tasks
- Profile memory usage with large web pages and optimize
- Implement streaming processing for large content when possible
- Optimize HTML-to-markdown conversion for performance
- Add connection pooling and reuse for multiple requests
- Implement graceful degradation for memory pressure

## Implementation Details
- Use memory profiling to identify optimization opportunities  
- Configure markdowndown client for optimal performance
- Implement content streaming where supported
- Add connection pooling configuration
- Monitor and log memory usage patterns
- Implement content truncation strategies for large responses

## Success Criteria
- Memory usage is reasonable for typical web page sizes
- Performance is acceptable for common use cases
- Large content is handled efficiently
- Connection resources are managed properly
- Memory leaks are eliminated
- Performance metrics are logged

## Dependencies
- Requires fetch_000012_security-testing (for complete implementation)

## Estimated Impact
- Ensures tool performance meets requirements
- Prevents resource exhaustion issues
