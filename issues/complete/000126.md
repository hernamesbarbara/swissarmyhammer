All examples in the documentation need to be tested.

Make the example workflow and prompts use a mdbook include (search the web for examples)

Then have an examples folder and a unit test that makes sure they all pass the equivalent of the validate command.

You need to check all markdown files in ./doc

## Proposed Solution
1. Create a new `doc/examples/` directory structure to organize all example code
2. Extract all examples from documentation files into separate files, organized by type:
   - `doc/examples/prompts/` - for prompt YAML examples
   - `doc/examples/workflows/` - for workflow mermaid examples
   - `doc/examples/scripts/` - for bash/python script examples
   - `doc/examples/configs/` - for configuration examples (like tasks.json)
3. Update documentation files to use mdbook's `{{#include}}` syntax to include examples
4. Create a test file `swissarmyhammer-cli/tests/test_doc_examples.rs` that:
   - Walks through all files in `doc/examples/prompts/`
   - Validates each prompt file using the existing validation logic
   - Ensures all examples pass validation without errors
5. Update the mdbook build process to ensure examples are properly included
