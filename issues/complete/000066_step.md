# Step 66: Implement Claude Command Execution Integration

## Goal
Integrate the workflow executor with Claude command execution, allowing workflow states to trigger prompts and process responses.

## Context
Each workflow state can define actions that should be executed, primarily involving sending prompts to Claude and processing the responses.

## Requirements
1. Create `workflow/actions.rs` module
2. Define action types:
   - `PromptAction` - Execute a prompt
   - `WaitAction` - Pause execution
   - `LogAction` - Log messages
   - `SetVariableAction` - Update context
3. Implement Claude integration:
   - Execute prompts from workflow context
   - Capture responses in workflow variables
   - Handle errors and timeouts
4. Create action parser for state descriptions

## Implementation Notes
- State descriptions contain action definitions
- Support variable substitution in prompts
- Actions can reference existing prompts by name
- Parse action syntax from state descriptions:
  ```
  State1: Execute prompt "analyze-code" with file="${current_file}"
  State2: Wait for user confirmation
  State3: Set result="${claude_response}"
  ```
- Async execution for Claude API calls
- Timeout handling for long-running prompts

## Success Criteria
- Can execute prompts from workflow states
- Variable substitution works correctly
- Responses captured in workflow context
- Error handling for failed prompts
- Integration tests with mock Claude responses
