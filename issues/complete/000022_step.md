# Step 22: Add Export and Import Commands for Prompt Sharing

## Goal
Implement `export` and `import` commands to facilitate sharing prompt collections between users and teams.

## Context
Users often want to share their carefully crafted prompts with teammates or the community. Having a standard export format makes this easy and preserves all metadata.

## Requirements
1. Add `export` subcommand:
   - Export single prompt: `swissarmyhammer export prompt-name`
   - Export category: `swissarmyhammer export --category debug`
   - Export all: `swissarmyhammer export --all`
   - Output formats: tar.gz (default), zip, directory
   - Preserve directory structure and metadata
2. Add `import` subcommand:
   - Import archive: `swissarmyhammer import prompts.tar.gz`
   - Import from URL: `swissarmyhammer import https://example.com/prompts.tar.gz`
   - Import from Git: `swissarmyhammer import git@github.com:user/prompts.git`
   - Preview mode: `--dry-run` shows what would be imported
   - Conflict resolution: `--strategy` skip/overwrite/rename/merge
3. Metadata preservation:
   - Include manifest.json with export metadata
   - Version compatibility checking
   - Author information and licensing
   - Dependencies between prompts
4. Safety features:
   - Validate imported prompts before installation
   - Backup existing prompts before overwrite
   - Show diff for conflicts
   - Rollback capability on errors

## Implementation Notes
- Use `tar` and `flate2` crates for compression
- Support `.gitignore`-style exclusion patterns
- Consider signing exports for authenticity
- Make Git import work with subfolders

## Success Criteria
- Users can easily share prompt collections
- Import process is safe and won't break existing setup
- Exports are self-contained and portable
- URL and Git imports work reliably
- Clear feedback during import/export process
