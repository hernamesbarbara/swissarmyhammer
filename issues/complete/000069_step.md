# Step 69: Implement Workflow Delegation and Nesting

## Goal
Enable workflows to call other workflows as sub-workflows, supporting modular and reusable workflow design.

## Context
Complex workflows benefit from decomposition. Supporting workflow delegation allows building larger workflows from smaller, tested components.

## Requirements
1. Add `SubWorkflowAction` action type
2. Extend executor to:
   - Launch sub-workflows
   - Pass variables to sub-workflows
   - Capture sub-workflow results
   - Handle sub-workflow errors
3. Parser support for delegation syntax:
   ```
   DelegateState: Run workflow "validation-workflow" with input="${data}"
   ```
4. Execution features:
   - Nested execution contexts
   - Variable scoping rules
   - Stack depth limits
   - Circular dependency detection

## Implementation Notes
- Sub-workflows run in child context
- Parent variables accessible (read-only)
- Sub-workflow results returned to parent
- Support async and sync delegation
- Track execution stack for debugging
- Prevent infinite recursion

## Success Criteria
- Can call workflows from workflows
- Variable passing works correctly
- Results propagate to parent
- Circular dependencies detected
- Tests with nested workflows
