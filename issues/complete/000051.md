If a file ending in .liquid has a marker comment

{% # partial %}

then DO NOT validate yaml front matter

DO validate that it is valid liquid and parse it, reporting errors

If a file ending in .liquid DOES NOT have the marker comment, validate as normal.

In the validate command if a file fails validation, and ends in .liquid, have the message additionally say

ðŸ’¡ Add {% # partial %} to disable YAML front matter checking
