I can `test` a prompt from the cli that has an include, but when running from Claude in MCP I get an error.


XF [McpError]: MCP error -32603: Template rendering error: Template error: liquid: Partial does not exist
  with:
    name=principals.liquid
from: {% render "principals" %}

test it, for real, end to end with McpClient
