‚óè Local prompts (./prompts/)

this needs to be (./.swissarmyhammer/prompts) -- that's there the files are

## Proposed Solution

After analyzing the codebase, I found that the prompt resolution system is already designed to load local prompts from `.swissarmyhammer/prompts/` directories. However, some user-facing documentation and examples still reference the old `./prompts/` location.

The changes needed are:

1. **Update CLI display message** in `swissarmyhammer-cli/src/list.rs:224` to show "./.swissarmyhammer/prompts/" instead of "./prompts/"
2. **Update documentation examples** in `swissarmyhammer/src/prompts.rs:510` and line 586 to use ".swissarmyhammer/prompts"
3. **Update example code** in `swissarmyhammer/examples/basic_usage.rs:53-54` to check for and load from ".swissarmyhammer/prompts"
4. **Update lib.rs documentation** comment on line 23 to use ".swissarmyhammer/prompts"
5. **Review and update** any other documentation files that reference the old path

These changes will align the user-facing documentation with the actual implementation, which already uses the `.swissarmyhammer/prompts/` structure.
