# OUTLINE_000248: Dart Language Support

Refer to ./specification/outline_tool.md

## Summary

Implement comprehensive Dart language support for the outline tool, including extraction of classes, mixins, enums, functions, methods, properties, constructors, and Dartdoc comments with proper type information and library/part handling.

## Context

Dart has unique language features including mixins, factory constructors, extension methods, and a distinctive documentation system. The implementation should handle Flutter-specific patterns and modern Dart language features.

## Requirements

### 1. Dart Symbol Types
Support all major Dart constructs:
- **Classes**: Regular classes, abstract classes with inheritance
- **Mixins**: Mixin declarations and usage
- **Enums**: Enum definitions with values and methods
- **Extensions**: Extension methods on existing types
- **Functions**: Top-level functions and local functions
- **Methods**: Instance methods, static methods, operators
- **Constructors**: Named constructors, factory constructors
- **Properties**: Fields, getters, setters
- **Typedefs**: Function type definitions
- **Libraries**: Library declarations and exports
- **Parts**: Part declarations and part of statements

### 2. Dart-Specific Features
- **Access modifiers**: Public (default) and private (_prefixed)
- **Optional parameters**: Named and positional optional parameters
- **Generic types**: Generic classes, methods, and functions
- **Async/await**: Async functions and generators
- **Factory constructors**: Factory keyword and patterns
- **Operator overloading**: Custom operator implementations
- **Extension methods**: Methods added to existing types
- **Late initialization**: late keyword for variables

### 3. Dartdoc Comment Extraction
- **Dartdoc comments**: `///` and `/**` patterns
- **Documentation tags**: @param, @returns, @throws
- **Code examples**: Code blocks in documentation
- **Cross-references**: Links to other code elements

## Technical Details

### Dart Extractor Implementation
```rust
pub struct DartExtractor {
    query: Query,
}

impl SymbolExtractor for DartExtractor {
    fn extract_symbols(&self, tree: &Tree, source: &str) -> Vec<OutlineNode> {
        // Implementation for Dart-specific symbol extraction
    }
}
```

### Tree-sitter Queries for Dart
Define comprehensive queries:

```scheme
; Class definitions
(class_definition
  name: (identifier) @class.name
  (extends_clause (type_identifier) @class.extends)?
  (with_clause (type_identifier) @class.mixins)*
  (implements_clause (type_identifier) @class.implements)*
  body: (class_body) @class.body)

; Method definitions
(method_signature
  name: (identifier) @method.name
  parameters: (formal_parameter_list) @method.params
  return_type: (type_annotation)? @method.return)

; Constructor definitions
(constructor_signature
  name: (identifier)? @constructor.name
  parameters: (formal_parameter_list) @constructor.params)

; Factory constructors
(factory_constructor_signature
  name: (identifier) @factory.name
  parameters: (formal_parameter_list) @factory.params)

; Mixin definitions
(mixin_declaration
  name: (identifier) @mixin.name
  (on_clause (type_identifier) @mixin.on)*
  body: (class_body) @mixin.body)

; Extension definitions
(extension_declaration
  name: (identifier)? @extension.name
  (on_clause (type_identifier) @extension.on)
  body: (extension_body) @extension.body)
```

### Signature Generation
Generate accurate Dart signatures:

```rust
fn extract_dart_signature(node: &Node, source: &str) -> Option<String> {
    match node.kind() {
        "class_definition" => extract_class_signature(node, source),
        "mixin_declaration" => extract_mixin_signature(node, source),
        "extension_declaration" => extract_extension_signature(node, source),
        "method_signature" => extract_method_signature(node, source),
        "constructor_signature" => extract_constructor_signature(node, source),
        "factory_constructor_signature" => extract_factory_signature(node, source),
        _ => None,
    }
}
```

Example signatures:
- `class Repository<T> extends BaseRepository<T> with CacheMixin implements DataSource<T>`
- `mixin ValidationMixin<T> on BaseModel<T>`
- `extension StringExtensions on String`
- `factory User.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json)`
- `Future<List<T>> fetchData<T>({required String endpoint, Map<String, String>? headers})`
- `void operator []=(int index, T value)`

### Dartdoc Integration
Extract comprehensive documentation:
```rust
fn extract_dartdoc_comment(node: &Node, source: &str) -> Option<String> {
    // Parse Dartdoc comments and extract structured information
    // Handle /// comments and /** */ blocks
}
```

## Implementation Steps

2. Define Tree-sitter queries for all Dart constructs
3. Implement class, mixin, and extension extraction
4. Add constructor and factory constructor handling
5. Implement method and property extraction with proper signatures
6. Add async/await and generator function support
7. Implement Dartdoc comment parsing
8. Handle library and part declarations
9. Create comprehensive tests with real Dart/Flutter code

## Testing Requirements

### Test Cases
Create test files covering:

**Core Dart Features**:
```dart
/// Repository for managing user data
abstract class UserRepository<T extends User> 
    extends BaseRepository<T> 
    with CacheMixin<T> 
    implements DataSource<T> {
  
  /// Create a new user repository
  /// 
  /// [cacheSize] specifies the maximum cache size
  UserRepository({int cacheSize = 100});
  
  /// Factory constructor for creating from configuration
  factory UserRepository.fromConfig(Config config) {
    return DatabaseUserRepository<T>(config);
  }
  
  /// Find user by ID
  /// 
  /// Returns [null] if user not found
  /// Throws [UserNotFoundException] if ID is invalid
  Future<T?> findById(String id);
  
  /// Save user data
  /// 
  /// [user] the user to save
  /// [options] optional save configuration
  Future<T> save(T user, {SaveOptions? options});
  
  /// Operator overload for array-like access
  T? operator [](String id) => findByIdSync(id);
}

/// Mixin for caching functionality
mixin CacheMixin<T> on BaseRepository<T> {
  final Map<String, T> _cache = {};
  
  /// Get item from cache
  T? getCached(String key) => _cache[key];
  
  /// Store item in cache
  void setCached(String key, T value) {
    _cache[key] = value;
  }
}

/// Extension methods for String validation
extension StringValidation on String {
  /// Check if string is a valid email
  bool get isValidEmail {
    return RegExp(r'^[\w-\.]+@([\w-]+\.)+[\w-]{2,4}$').hasMatch(this);
  }
  
  /// Capitalize first letter
  String get capitalized {
    if (isEmpty) return this;
    return '${this[0].toUpperCase()}${substring(1)}';
  }
}

/// Enum for user roles
enum UserRole {
  admin('Administrator'),
  user('Regular User'),
  guest('Guest User');
  
  const UserRole(this.displayName);
  
  /// Human-readable display name
  final String displayName;
  
  /// Check if role has admin privileges
  bool get hasAdminPrivileges => this == UserRole.admin;
}

/// Process user data asynchronously
/// 
/// [users] list of users to process
/// [processor] function to apply to each user
/// Returns stream of processed results
Stream<ProcessResult> processUsers(
  List<User> users,
  Future<ProcessResult> Function(User) processor,
) async* {
  for (final user in users) {
    yield await processor(user);
  }
}
```

### Expected Output Structure
```yaml
UserRepository:
  kind: class
  line: 2
  signature: "abstract class UserRepository<T extends User> extends BaseRepository<T> with CacheMixin<T> implements DataSource<T>"
  doc: "Repository for managing user data"
  children:
    - name: "UserRepository"
      kind: constructor
      signature: "UserRepository({int cacheSize = 100})"
      doc: "Create a new user repository"
      line: 8
    - name: "fromConfig"
      kind: factory
      signature: "factory UserRepository.fromConfig(Config config)"
      doc: "Factory constructor for creating from configuration"
      line: 12
    - name: "findById"
      kind: method
      signature: "Future<T?> findById(String id)"
      doc: "Find user by ID"
      line: 18
```

- Standard library components

## Notes

Dart has unique features like mixins and factory constructors that need special handling. The implementation should also consider Flutter-specific patterns since many Dart projects are Flutter applications. Pay attention to the distinction between sync and async methods, and handle generator functions appropriately.

## Proposed Solution

Based on my analysis of the current outline tool architecture and existing extractor patterns, I will implement comprehensive Dart language support following these steps:

### Implementation Strategy

1. **Leverage Existing Infrastructure**
   - Use the established `SymbolExtractor` trait and `OutlineNode` types
   - Follow the pattern used by `RustExtractor`, `TypeScriptExtractor`, and `JavaScriptExtractor`
   - Utilize `tree-sitter-dart = "0.0.4"` which is already available in dependencies

2. **Dart-Specific Features to Handle**
   - **Classes**: Regular and abstract classes with inheritance, implements, and with clauses
   - **Mixins**: Mixin declarations with `on` constraints
   - **Extensions**: Extension methods on existing types
   - **Enums**: Modern Dart enums with values, methods, and constructors
   - **Constructors**: Named constructors, factory constructors, const constructors
   - **Functions**: Top-level functions, async functions, generator functions
   - **Methods**: Instance methods, static methods, operator overloading
   - **Properties**: Fields, getters, setters with proper type information
   - **Generics**: Generic types with bounds and constraints
   - **Library/Part**: Library declarations and part files

3. **Tree-sitter Query Design**
   - Define comprehensive queries for all Dart language constructs
   - Handle nested structures (methods within classes, etc.)
   - Extract proper signatures with generic types and optional parameters
   - Support Dart's unique syntax patterns (factory, mixin, extension)

4. **Signature Generation**
   - Generate accurate Dart signatures including:
     - Generic type parameters with bounds
     - Optional positional and named parameters
     - Return types and async/Future return types
     - Factory constructor patterns
     - Mixin and extension signatures

5. **Documentation Extraction**
   - Support Dart's `///` documentation comments
   - Handle `/** */` block comments
   - Extract parameter documentation and examples
   - Parse `@param`, `@returns`, `@throws` tags

### Technical Implementation

```rust
// Core structure following existing pattern
pub struct DartExtractor {
    queries: HashMap<OutlineNodeType, Query>,
}

// Key Dart node types to support
- Function (top-level functions, async functions)
- Method (instance methods, static methods, operators)
- Class (regular classes, abstract classes)  
- Enum (modern Dart enums with methods)
- Mixin (mixin declarations)
- Extension (extension methods)
- Constructor (named, factory, const constructors)
- Property (fields, getters, setters)
```

### Integration Points

1. Update `src/outline/extractors/mod.rs` to include `DartExtractor`
2. Update parser integration to use `DartExtractor` for `.dart` files
3. Ensure `Language::Dart` is properly handled throughout the pipeline
4. Add comprehensive test coverage with real Flutter/Dart examples

### Success Criteria

- All major Dart language constructs are extracted correctly
- Proper signature generation with generics and optional parameters
- Dartdoc comments are extracted and formatted
- Flutter-specific patterns (Widgets, State classes) work correctly
- Performance is suitable for large Flutter applications
- Integration tests pass with real Dart/Flutter codebases

### Test Coverage

Will create test files covering:
- Flutter Widget hierarchies
- State management patterns (Provider, Bloc, etc.)
- Mixin usage patterns
- Extension method implementations
- Factory constructor patterns
- Async/await and Stream usage
- Generic type constraints
- Complex inheritance hierarchies

This implementation will provide comprehensive Dart language support that matches the quality and completeness of the existing Rust, TypeScript, and JavaScript extractors.
