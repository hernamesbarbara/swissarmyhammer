# Step 68: Implement Flow CLI Command

## Goal
Create the `flow` CLI command for executing workflows with support for starting new runs and resuming existing ones.

## Context
Users need a CLI interface to execute workflows. The flow command will be the primary interface for workflow execution.

## Requirements
1. Add `flow` command to CLI with subcommands:
   - `flow run <workflow>` - Start new workflow
   - `flow resume <run_id>` - Resume existing run
   - `flow list` - List available workflows
   - `flow status <run_id>` - Check run status
   - `flow logs <run_id>` - View execution logs
2. Command options:
   - `--vars` - Pass initial variables
   - `--interactive` - Step-by-step execution
   - `--dry-run` - Show execution plan
   - `--timeout` - Set execution timeout
3. Output formatting:
   - Progress indicators
   - State transition logs
   - Final results display

## Implementation Notes
- Generate unique run IDs (UUID)
- Store run logs in `.swissarmyhammer/runs/`
- Support JSON/YAML variable input
- Interactive mode prompts at each state
- Colorized output for better readability
- Handle Ctrl+C gracefully

## Success Criteria
- All flow subcommands implemented
- Can start and resume workflows
- Clear progress output
- Proper error handling
- Integration tests for CLI commands
