# Step 65: Create Workflow Execution Engine Core

## Goal
Build the core execution engine that runs workflows by managing state transitions and executing state actions.

## Context
The execution engine is the heart of the workflow system. It manages the current state, evaluates transitions, and coordinates action execution.

## Requirements
1. Create `workflow/executor.rs` module
2. Implement `WorkflowExecutor` struct with:
   - State management
   - Transition evaluation
   - Variable context management
   - Event handling
3. Core execution methods:
   - `start_workflow()` - Initialize new run
   - `resume_workflow()` - Resume from saved state
   - `execute_state()` - Run current state action
   - `evaluate_transitions()` - Check transition conditions
   - `transition_to()` - Move to next state

## Implementation Notes
- Design for async execution
- Support synchronous state transitions
- Maintain execution history for debugging
- Handle errors gracefully with state rollback
- Create execution context for variable passing
- Log all state transitions

## Success Criteria
- Basic workflow execution works
- Can start and transition between states
- State context preserved during execution
- Error handling prevents stuck workflows
- Unit tests for execution scenarios
