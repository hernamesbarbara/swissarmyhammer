I expect to see the built in workflows.

Make a simple 'hello-world' workflow builtin to test this.

## Proposed Solution

1. Create a simple hello-world workflow that demonstrates basic workflow functionality
2. Update the build.rs to include a workflow generation step similar to how builtin prompts work
3. Update the load_builtin_workflows method in workflow/storage.rs to actually load the generated builtin workflows
4. Write tests to verify the hello-world workflow loads and executes correctly
5. Ensure the workflow appears in the flow list output
