Claude output lines, for example:

2025-07-11T12:10:15.662885Z DEBUG swissarmyhammer::workflow::actions: Claude output line: {"type":"user","message":{"role":"user","content":[{"tool_use_id":"toolu_01HHxb5NnvSfUxwCTQptWWaE","type":"tool_result","content":"Todos have been modified successfully. Ensure that you continue to use the todo list to track your progress. Please proceed with the current tasks if applicable"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"e99afa02-75bc-4f2f-baef-68d5e071f023"}

need to log in YAML like this

2025-07-11T12:10:15.662885Z DEBUG swissarmyhammer::workflow::actions: Claude output line:
type: user
message:
  ...

## Proposed Solution

1. Add a YAML serialization dependency (serde_yaml) to the project
2. Create a helper function to format JSON objects as YAML
3. Modify the logging statement at line 395 in actions.rs to:
   - Parse the JSON line
   - Convert it to YAML format
   - Log it with proper indentation
4. Write a test to ensure YAML output is correctly formatted
5. Handle edge cases where the line might not be valid JSON
