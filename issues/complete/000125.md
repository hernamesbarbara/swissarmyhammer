Use chumsky = "0.10.1" (<https://crates.io/crates/chumsky>) to create a proper parser for the ActionParser.

Parsing of all action phrases and keywords needs to be case insensitive.

Pay attention to the fact that part of the action is CEL and needs to be handed off to another parser.

Write clear example comments in rustdoc commands before each parser function with examples that will be parsed.

## Proposed Solution

1. Add chumsky = "0.10.1" to the Cargo.toml dependencies
2. Create a new ActionParser implementation using chumsky parser combinators
3. Implement parsers for each action type:
   - Prompt actions: `Execute prompt "name" with arg="value"`
   - Wait actions: `Wait N seconds/minutes/hours` or `Wait for user`
   - Log actions: `Log [error|warning] "message"`
   - Set variable actions: `Set var="value"`
   - Sub-workflow actions: `Run workflow "name"` or `Delegate to "name"`
4. Make all keywords case-insensitive (Execute/execute, Wait/wait, etc.)
5. Preserve the existing public API to ensure backward compatibility
6. Keep CEL expressions in values/arguments as-is without parsing them
7. Maintain the existing substitute_variables_safe function
8. Ensure all existing tests continue to pass
