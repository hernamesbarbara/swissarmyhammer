# Step 73: Implement Error Handling and Recovery

## Goal
Add comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms to make workflows resilient to failures.

## Context
Production workflows must handle errors gracefully and provide recovery options to ensure reliability.

## Requirements
1. Error handling strategies:
   - Retry with backoff
   - Fallback states
   - Error handlers
   - Compensation/rollback
2. Add error state support:
   ```mermaid
   stateDiagram-v2
       Process --> ProcessError: on_error
       ProcessError --> Retry: retry_count < 3
       ProcessError --> Compensate: retry_count >= 3
   ```
3. Recovery features:
   - Automatic retries
   - Manual intervention points
   - Skip failed states
   - Resume from specific state
4. Error context:
   - Capture error details
   - Stack traces
   - Previous attempts
   - Recovery suggestions

## Implementation Notes
- Define error boundaries
- Exponential backoff for retries
- Configurable retry policies
- Dead letter states
- Human-in-the-loop recovery
- Preserve error history

## Success Criteria
- Workflows handle errors gracefully
- Retry mechanisms work correctly
- Can recover from failures
- Clear error reporting
- Tests for various failure scenarios
