# Step 63: Implement Workflow Parser Adapter

## Goal
Create the adapter layer that converts mermaid_parser output into our Workflow data structures with validation and enrichment.

## Context
With mermaid_parser integrated, we need to adapt its output to our specific workflow needs and add workflow-specific validation.

## Requirements
1. Implement adapter that:
   - Converts mermaid_parser diagrams to Workflow objects
   - Extracts state descriptions and actions
   - Parses transition conditions
   - Identifies special states (fork/join/choice)
2. Add workflow-specific parsing:
   - Action extraction from state descriptions
   - Variable references in conditions
   - Fork/join detection
   - Choice state identification
3. Validation logic:
   - Ensure single start state
   - Verify all states reachable
   - Check for disconnected components

## Implementation Notes
- Parse state descriptions for actions:
  ```
  stateDiagram-v2
      [*] --> CheckingInput: Start workflow
      CheckingInput --> ProcessingData: Input valid
      CheckingInput --> ErrorState: Input invalid
      ProcessingData --> [*]: Complete
      ErrorState --> [*]: Abort
  ```
- Extract action syntax from descriptions:
  - `State: Execute prompt "name"`
  - `State: Set variable="value"`
  - `State: Run workflow "sub-workflow"`
- Handle mermaid_parser limitations gracefully

## Success Criteria
- Adapter converts all diagram types
- Actions correctly extracted
- Conditions parsed properly
- Validation catches invalid workflows
- Comprehensive test coverage
