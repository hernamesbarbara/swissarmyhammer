This is incorrect behavior:

```

```

when running search or index at the root of a repository, this case swissarmyhammer itself, the semantic db was created in my home directory.

i already gave you an issue about this, I really mean it -- the semantic db should NEVER be in the user home directory, it ONLY should be in a .swissarmyhammer directory in a local repository

Last time you didn't even make a plan or try: /Users/wballard/github/swissarmyhammer/issues/complete/01K13M176K23E2CRRSFYEYV4WM.md

THINK. Fix this!

## Proposed Solution

The semantic database location resolution needs to follow the same precedence pattern as other SwissArmyHammer resources:

1. **Current Issue**: Semantic storage only checks user home directory (`~/.swissarmyhammer/semantic.db`)
2. **Required Behavior**: Check for local repository `.swissarmyhammer/` directory first, fallback to user home
3. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Find the semantic storage initialization code
   - Locate existing repository detection logic (used by PromptResolver/WorkflowResolver)
   - Update semantic storage path resolution to:
     - First check for `.swissarmyhammer/` in current directory or parent directories
     - Only fallback to `~/.swissarmyhammer/` if no local repository directory found
   - Write tests to verify both local and fallback behaviors
   - Ensure existing functionality remains intact

This will align semantic storage with the documented "Standard Locations" pattern from CODING_STANDARDS.md:
- Local: `./.swissarmyhammer/` (in current directory or parents) - **PREFERRED**
- User: `~/.swissarmyhammer/` - **FALLBACK ONLY**
