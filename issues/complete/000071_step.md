# Step 71: Implement Workflow Monitoring and Observability

## Goal
Add comprehensive monitoring, logging, and observability features to track workflow execution and diagnose issues.

## Context
Production workflows need detailed monitoring to understand performance, track failures, and debug issues.

## Requirements
1. Create structured logging for workflows:
   - State entry/exit events
   - Transition decisions
   - Action execution times
   - Variable changes
   - Error details
2. Add metrics collection:
   - Execution duration per state
   - Transition counts
   - Success/failure rates
   - Resource usage
3. Implement execution visualization:
   - Export execution trace
   - Generate Mermaid diagrams with execution overlay
   - Show actual path taken

## Implementation Notes
- Use tracing crate for structured logging
- Support different log levels
- Store logs with run data
- Generate execution reports
- Optional OpenTelemetry integration
- Create visual execution traces:
  ```mermaid
  stateDiagram-v2
      [*] --> State1: ✓ 2.3s
      State1 --> State2: ✓ 0.1s
      State2 --> State3: ✗ failed
  ```

## Success Criteria
- Detailed execution logs available
- Metrics tracked for all executions
- Can generate visual execution reports
- Performance data accessible
- Integration with existing logging
