Get rid of the changelog and install.sh

## Proposed Solution

I will remove the following files from the repository:

1. **CHANGELOG.md** from the root directory - This file appears to be legacy documentation that is no longer needed
2. **install.sh** from the root directory - Legacy installation script
3. **install.sh** from the dist/ directory - Another copy of the installation script

These files appear to be remnants from an earlier version of the project setup and are no longer relevant to the current codebase architecture. The removal will clean up the repository structure and eliminate unused files.

Implementation steps:
1. Remove `/Users/wballard/github/swissarmyhammer/CHANGELOG.md`
2. Remove `/Users/wballard/github/swissarmyhammer/install.sh`  
3. Remove `/Users/wballard/github/swissarmyhammer/dist/install.sh`
