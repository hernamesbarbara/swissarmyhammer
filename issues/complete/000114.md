The `validate` subcommand should move to the root as it validate workflow and prompts.

## Proposed Solution

Move the `validate` subcommand from `swissarmyhammer prompt validate` to `swissarmyhammer validate` at the root level. This makes sense because validation operates on both prompts AND workflows, not just prompts.

### Changes Required:

1. **CLI Structure Changes (cli.rs):**
   - Move `Validate` variant from `PromptSubcommand` enum to root `Commands` enum
   - Update command documentation to reflect new position

2. **Main Handler (main.rs):**
   - Add new `Commands::Validate` case in the match statement
   - Create dedicated `run_validate` function to handle the command

3. **Prompt Module (prompt.rs):**
   - Remove `PromptSubcommand::Validate` case from the match statement
   - Keep validate module import only for the new root handler

4. **Tests:**
   - Update all CLI tests to use new command structure (`swissarmyhammer validate` instead of `swissarmyhammer prompt validate`)
   - Ensure all existing functionality is preserved

### Benefits:
- Better reflects that validation covers both prompts and workflows
- Simpler command structure: `swissarmyhammer validate` vs `swissarmyhammer prompt validate`
- More logical organization of CLI commands
