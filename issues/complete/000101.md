Documentation needs to cover the use of liquid templates and partials.

## Proposed Solution

After analyzing the codebase, I found that:

1. **Liquid templates are already documented** in `doc/src/template-variables.md`
2. **Partials functionality is implemented** in the codebase using `{% render %}` syntax
3. **Documentation is outdated** - it incorrectly states "No includes: Cannot include other template files"

### Implementation Steps

1. **Update the Limitations section** in `template-variables.md` to remove the incorrect statement about includes
2. **Add a comprehensive Partials section** that covers:
   - How to create partials using the `{% partial %}` tag
   - How to use partials with `{% render "partial_name" %}`
   - Partial resolution (how SwissArmyHammer finds partials)
   - Supported file extensions (.md, .liquid, .md.liquid, .liquid.markdown)
   - Examples of organizing partials in directories
   - Best practices for partial usage

3. **Add practical examples** showing:
   - Basic partial usage
   - Partials with arguments
   - Organizing partials in subdirectories
   - Common use cases for partials

4. **Update cross-references** to point to the new partials documentation

This will ensure users have complete documentation for both liquid templates and partials functionality.
