`swissarmyhammer serve` is not exiting when Claude exits

you need to research MCP shutdown

## Proposed Solution

The issue is that when the MCP client (Claude) disconnects, the serve command continues running instead of exiting gracefully. The current implementation only waits for Ctrl+C signals and doesn't detect when the stdio connection is closed.

The challenge is that the `rmcp` crate's `serve_server` function returns a `RunningService` handle that doesn't provide a direct way to detect when the transport closes. The stdio transport should detect when the client disconnects (EOF on stdin), but we need a way to be notified of this event.

After investigating several approaches, the issue requires further research into the `rmcp` crate's API to find the proper way to:
1. Detect when the stdio transport closes (client disconnect)
2. Gracefully shutdown the server when this happens
3. Not interfere with the MCP protocol's use of stdio

Current workaround: The server can be stopped with Ctrl+C, but doesn't automatically exit when Claude disconnects.
