Validate when running

`cargo run validate`

is validating /Users/wballard/github/swissarmyhammer/tests/workflows/nested.md

which is *not* a file in home directory, built in, or .swissarmyhammer


this tells me we have YET AGAIN duplicated the loading logic and are not loading
for validate the same way we are for list.

If you run `cargo run flow list` you will see that this nested.md is not in there.

## Proposed Solution

1. Replace the custom directory walking in `validate_all_workflows` with `WorkflowResolver::load_all_workflows`
2. This will ensure the validate command only loads workflows from standard locations:
   - Builtin workflows (embedded in binary)
   - User workflows (~/.swissarmyhammer/workflows)
   - Local workflows (./.swissarmyhammer/workflows)
3. This matches the behavior of `flow list` and ensures consistency
