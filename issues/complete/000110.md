I'm getting

Configuration:
  ✗ Claude Code MCP configuration - Claude Code command not found
    → Install Claude Code from <https://claude.ai/code> or ensure the 'claude' command is in your PATH


from `doctor`

but claude really is in my path

## Proposed Solution

The issue was that the doctor command was attempting to execute `claude mcp list` directly without first checking if the `claude` executable exists in the PATH. This could fail with a misleading error even when `claude` is actually in the PATH, due to differences in how the shell and the process environment handle PATH resolution.

The solution involves:
1. First manually search for the `claude` executable in the PATH directories
2. Check for platform-specific executable names (claude.exe, claude.cmd, claude.bat on Windows)
3. Only attempt to execute the command if the executable is found
4. Provide more detailed error messages that include PATH information for debugging

This fix ensures that:
- Users get accurate error messages about whether `claude` is found in PATH
- The error message distinguishes between "not found in PATH" and "found but failed to execute"
- Cross-platform compatibility is maintained with proper path separator handling
