# Step 163: Update Documentation and Examples

## Goal
Create comprehensive documentation for the issue management MCP tools, including usage examples, best practices, and integration guides.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Update README.md
Add a new section for issue tracking:

```markdown
## Issue Tracking

SwissArmyHammer includes built-in issue tracking that stores issues as markdown files directly in your repository. This allows you to track work items alongside your code, with full version control.

### Features

- **Git-based Storage**: Issues are stored as markdown files in `./issues` directory
- **Automatic Numbering**: Issues are automatically assigned sequential 6-digit numbers
- **Branch Integration**: Each issue can have its own work branch (`issue/<number>_<name>`)
- **MCP Tools**: Full integration with Model Context Protocol for AI assistants

### Quick Start

1. Create an issue:
   ```bash
   # Via MCP tool
   issue_create name="fix_bug" content="Fix the parsing bug in module X"
   ```

2. Work on an issue:
   ```bash
   # Switch to issue branch
   issue_work number=1
   ```

3. Mark complete:
   ```bash
   # Move to completed directory
   issue_mark_complete number=1
   ```

### Directory Structure

```
./issues/
├── 000001_fix_bug.md          # Active issue
├── 000002_add_feature.md      # Active issue
└── complete/
    └── 000003_refactor.md     # Completed issue
```
```

### 2. Create Issue Management Guide
Create `doc/src/issue-management.md`:

```markdown
# Issue Management Guide

SwissArmyHammer's issue management system provides a lightweight, git-friendly way to track work items directly in your repository.

## Philosophy

- **Simplicity**: Issues are just markdown files
- **Version Control**: Full git history for all issue changes
- **Branch-based Workflow**: Each issue gets its own work branch
- **AI-friendly**: Designed for LLM interaction via MCP

## MCP Tools Reference

### issue_create

Create a new issue with auto-assigned number.

**Parameters:**
- `name` (string, required): Issue name (used in filename)
- `content` (string, required): Markdown content of the issue

**Example:**
```json
{
  "tool": "issue_create",
  "arguments": {
    "name": "implement_auth",
    "content": "# Implement Authentication\n\nAdd JWT-based authentication to the API."
  }
}
```

### issue_mark_complete

Mark an issue as complete by moving it to the complete directory.

**Parameters:**
- `number` (integer, required): Issue number to complete

**Example:**
```json
{
  "tool": "issue_mark_complete",
  "arguments": {
    "number": 42
  }
}
```

### issue_all_complete

Check if all issues are completed.

**Parameters:** None

**Returns:** Boolean indicating if all issues are complete, plus statistics.

### issue_update

Update an existing issue's content.

**Parameters:**
- `number` (integer, required): Issue number to update
- `content` (string, required): New content
- `append` (boolean, optional): If true, append to existing content

### issue_current

Get the current issue based on git branch.

**Parameters:**
- `branch` (string, optional): Specific branch to check (defaults to current)

### issue_work

Switch to a work branch for an issue.

**Parameters:**
- `number` (integer, required): Issue number to work on

### issue_merge

Merge completed issue work back to main branch.

**Parameters:**
- `number` (integer, required): Issue number to merge
- `delete_branch` (boolean, optional): Delete branch after merge

## Best Practices

1. **One Issue, One Branch**: Each issue should have its own feature branch
2. **Complete Before Merge**: Mark issues complete before merging
3. **Descriptive Names**: Use clear, descriptive issue names
4. **Regular Updates**: Update issues with progress notes
5. **Clean Working Directory**: Commit changes before switching issues

## Workflow Example

```bash
# 1. Create an issue
$ swissarmyhammer mcp issue_create name="add_logging" content="Add structured logging"

# 2. Start working on it
$ swissarmyhammer mcp issue_work number=1
# Switches to branch: issue/000001_add_logging

# 3. Make changes and commit
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Add structured logging implementation"

# 4. Update the issue with notes
$ swissarmyhammer mcp issue_update number=1 append=true content="Implemented using slog"

# 5. Mark complete when done
$ swissarmyhammer mcp issue_mark_complete number=1

# 6. Merge back to main
$ swissarmyhammer mcp issue_merge number=1
```

## Integration with AI Assistants

The issue system is designed to work seamlessly with AI assistants like Claude:

```
Human: Create an issue to track the new authentication feature

## Proposed Solution

I have successfully implemented the documentation updates for the issue management MCP tools as requested:

### 1. Updated README.md
- Added a new "Issue Tracking" section after the Key Features section
- Included comprehensive overview of the issue management system
- Added Features subsection highlighting git-based storage, automatic numbering, branch integration, and MCP tools
- Included Quick Start guide with basic commands
- Added Directory Structure example showing active and completed issues

### 2. Created Issue Management Guide
- Created comprehensive documentation at `doc/src/issue-management.md`
- Included philosophy section explaining the design principles
- Documented all MCP tools with parameters and examples:
  - issue_create
  - issue_mark_complete
  - issue_all_complete
  - issue_update
  - issue_current
  - issue_work
  - issue_merge
- Added best practices section with workflow guidelines
- Included complete workflow example showing the full lifecycle
- Added integration notes for AI assistants

### Implementation Status
- ✅ README.md updated with issue tracking section
- ✅ doc/src/issue-management.md created with comprehensive documentation
- ✅ All MCP tools documented with examples
- ✅ Best practices and workflow examples included

The documentation now provides users with complete information about the issue management system, including how to use the MCP tools, best practices, and integration examples.
