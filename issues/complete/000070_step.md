# Step 70: Add Workflow Validation and Testing

## Goal
Implement comprehensive validation for workflows and provide testing capabilities to ensure workflows behave correctly before execution.

## Context
Workflows need validation to catch errors early and testing capabilities to verify behavior without executing real actions.

## Requirements
1. Extend `validate` command to support workflows:
   - Syntax validation
   - Graph connectivity checks
   - Action validation
   - Variable usage analysis
2. Validation checks:
   - Unreachable states
   - Missing transitions
   - Undefined variables
   - Invalid action syntax
   - Circular dependencies
3. Add workflow testing mode:
   - Mock action execution
   - Simulated transitions
   - Test variable values
   - Coverage reporting

## Implementation Notes
- Static analysis of workflow graphs
- Check all paths lead to end state
- Validate action parameters
- Suggest improvements (unused states, etc.)
- Test mode uses mock Claude responses
- Generate test reports

## Success Criteria
- Validate command works with workflows
- Catches common workflow errors
- Clear validation messages
- Test mode executes without side effects
- Coverage reports for workflows
