I am not seeing any of my prompts that I have in ~/.swissarmyhammer/prompts when running from Claude with MCP.

But, I do see them in `swissarmyhammer list`.


Did you go and not load prompts consistently again? -- I can see the prompt_loader.rs is in cli by the server is in sdk, so I'm thinking I caught you red handed...
