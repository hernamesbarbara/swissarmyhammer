The example actions workflow builting test needs to test branching.

## Proposed Solution

1. **Update the example-actions workflow** to include branching demonstrations:
   - Add choice states that demonstrate OnSuccess/OnFailure conditions
   - Include conditional transitions based on variable values
   - Show multiple paths through the workflow based on different conditions

2. **Create comprehensive tests** for the branching functionality:
   - Test successful branch execution (OnSuccess condition)
   - Test failure branch execution (OnFailure condition)
   - Test conditional branching based on context variables
   - Test choice states with multiple conditional transitions
   - Test that all branches in the example workflow are reachable and functional

3. **Test implementation steps**:
   - Create a test file specifically for testing the example-actions workflow
   - Write tests that execute the workflow with different contexts to trigger different branches
   - Verify that the correct path is taken based on the conditions
   - Ensure all demonstrated features work as documented
