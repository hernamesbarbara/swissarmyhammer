When detecting circular dependencies, only log the first one in `validate`.

Otherwise it is just too noisy.



Example


workflow:tdd
  WARN [-] Circular dependency detected: check -> loop -> test -> check
    ðŸ’¡ Ensure the workflow has proper exit conditions to avoid infinite loops
  WARN [-] Circular dependency detected: test -> check -> loop -> test
    ðŸ’¡ Ensure the workflow has proper exit conditions to avoid infinite loops
  WARN [-] Circular dependency detected: test -> check -> loop -> test
    ðŸ’¡ Ensure the workflow has proper exit conditions to avoid infinite loops
  WARN [-] Circular dependency detected: test -> check -> loop -> test
    ðŸ’¡ Ensure the workflow has proper exit conditions to avoid infinite loops



should be

workflow:tdd
  WARN [-] Circular dependency detected: check -> loop -> test -> check
    ðŸ’¡ Ensure the workflow has proper exit conditions to avoid infinite loops

## Proposed Solution

The issue is that the same circular dependency is being reported multiple times from different starting points. For example:
- check -> loop -> test -> check
- test -> check -> loop -> test
- loop -> test -> check -> loop

These are all the same cycle, just starting from different nodes.

To fix this:
1. Normalize cycles before reporting them (e.g., always start from the lexicographically smallest node)
2. Keep track of already reported cycles to avoid duplicates
3. Only show the first unique circular dependency detected

Implementation steps:
1. Create a test case that reproduces multiple circular dependency warnings
2. Modify the validate_workflow_structure method to normalize and deduplicate cycles
3. Ensure only the first unique cycle is reported
