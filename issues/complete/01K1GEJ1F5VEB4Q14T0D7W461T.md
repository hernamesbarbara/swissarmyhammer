In this block, if we are already in the target state, delete the issue file that is just under ./issues


```
        // Check if already in target state
        if issue.completed == to_completed {
            debug!("Issue {} already in target state", name);
            return Ok(issue);
        }
```

Research and find why the file did not move into ./issues/complete and fix the root cause too.

## Proposed Solution

After analyzing the code, I found the issue is in the `move_issue_by_name` function in `swissarmyhammer/src/issues/filesystem.rs` at lines 352-356.

### Root Cause Analysis

The problem occurs when there are duplicate issue files - one in `./issues/` and one in `./issues/complete/` with the same name. This can happen if:

1. An issue is created in `./issues/issue_name.md`
2. The issue is marked complete, moving it to `./issues/complete/issue_name.md`
3. Due to some error or external interference, the original file in `./issues/issue_name.md` still exists
4. When `mark_complete` is called again, `get_issue` finds the completed version (since `list_issues` is recursive) and returns early without cleaning up the duplicate in `./issues/`

### Current Logic Problem

```rust
// Check if already in target state
if issue.completed == to_completed {
    debug!("Issue {} already in target state", name);
    return Ok(issue);  // Returns early without cleanup
}
```

The issue is that when an issue is already in the target state, it returns early without checking for and cleaning up potential duplicates in the source directory.

### Proposed Fix

Modify the `move_issue_by_name` function to always check for and clean up duplicate files in the source directory, even when the issue is already in the target state:

```rust
// Check if already in target state
if issue.completed == to_completed {
    debug!("Issue {} already in target state", name);
    
    // Even if already in target state, check for and clean up duplicates
    let source_dir = if to_completed {
        &self.state.issues_dir  // Clean up pending directory if moving to completed
    } else {
        &self.state.completed_dir  // Clean up completed directory if moving to pending
    };
    
    // Check if there's a duplicate file in the source directory
    let filename = issue.file_path.file_name()
        .ok_or_else(|| SwissArmyHammerError::Other("Invalid file path".to_string()))?;
    let potential_duplicate = source_dir.join(filename);
    
    if potential_duplicate.exists() && potential_duplicate != issue.file_path {
        debug!("Found duplicate file at {}, removing it", potential_duplicate.display());
        std::fs::remove_file(&potential_duplicate).map_err(SwissArmyHammerError::Io)?;
    }
    
    return Ok(issue);
}
```

This ensures that even when an issue is already in the target state, any stray duplicate files are cleaned up.

## Implementation Steps

1. Implement the fix in `move_issue_by_name` function
2. Add a test case to verify duplicate cleanup behavior
3. Test the fix with various scenarios to ensure robustness
