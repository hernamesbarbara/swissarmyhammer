I want to be able to use `sah` as well as `swissarmyhammer` from the command line.

Build the app with two [[bin]] targets.

## Proposed Solution

1. Add a second [[bin]] target in swissarmyhammer-cli/Cargo.toml for "sah"
2. Both binaries will point to the same src/main.rs file
3. This will create two executable aliases that run the same program
4. Test that both commands work identically after building
