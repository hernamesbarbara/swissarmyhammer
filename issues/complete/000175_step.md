# SwissArmyHammer - Issue Management

SwissArmyHammer includes a comprehensive issue management system that integrates with git workflows and provides both MCP tools and CLI commands for managing project issues.

## Features

### ðŸŽ¯ Core Features
- **Git-based Workflow**: Each issue can have its own work branch
- **MCP Integration**: Full integration with Model Context Protocol for AI assistants
- **CLI Tools**: Complete command-line interface for issue management
- **Markdown Storage**: Issues stored as markdown files in your repository
- **Automatic Numbering**: Sequential 6-digit issue numbering (000001, 000002, etc.)
- **Completion Tracking**: Issues move from active to completed state

### ðŸ“‹ Issue Lifecycle
1. **Create** - Create new issues with `issue_create` or `swissarmyhammer issue create`
2. **Work** - Switch to issue work branch with `issue_work`
3. **Update** - Update issue content with `issue_update`
4. **Complete** - Mark issues complete with `issue_mark_complete`
5. **Merge** - Merge completed work with `issue_merge`

### ðŸ”§ MCP Tools
- `issue_create` - Create new issues
- `issue_mark_complete` - Mark issues as complete
- `issue_all_complete` - Check if all issues are completed
- `issue_update` - Update issue content
- `issue_current` - Get current issue from git branch
- `issue_work` - Start working on an issue
- `issue_merge` - Merge completed issue work

### ðŸ’» CLI Commands
- `swissarmyhammer issue create` - Create new issues
- `swissarmyhammer issue list` - List all issues
- `swissarmyhammer issue show` - Show issue details
- `swissarmyhammer issue update` - Update issue content
- `swissarmyhammer issue complete` - Mark issues complete
- `swissarmyhammer issue work` - Start working on an issue
- `swissarmyhammer issue merge` - Merge completed work
- `swissarmyhammer issue current` - Show current issue
- `swissarmyhammer issue status` - Show project status

## Quick Start

### 1. Create Your First Issue
```bash
# Using CLI
swissarmyhammer issue create "implement_auth" --content "Add JWT authentication"

# Using MCP (via Claude Code)
> Create an issue to implement JWT authentication
```

### 2. Start Working
```bash
# Switch to issue work branch
swissarmyhammer issue work 1

# Check current issue
swissarmyhammer issue current
```

### 3. Update Progress
```bash
# Update with progress notes
swissarmyhammer issue update 1 --content "Authentication implemented" --append

# Mark complete when done
swissarmyhammer issue complete 1
```

### 4. Merge to Main
```bash
# Merge completed work
swissarmyhammer issue merge 1
```

## Installation

Add SwissArmyHammer to your Claude Code MCP configuration:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "swissarmyhammer": {
      "command": "path/to/swissarmyhammer",
      "args": ["serve"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Configuration

Issues are stored in `./issues/` directory:
- Active issues: `./issues/000001_issue_name.md`
- Completed issues: `./issues/complete/000001_issue_name.md`

## Best Practices

1. **Use Descriptive Names**: Issue names become part of branch names
2. **Regular Updates**: Keep issues updated with progress notes
3. **Complete Before Merge**: Always mark issues complete before merging
4. **Clean Branches**: Use default branch deletion after merge
5. **Atomic Commits**: Make focused commits in issue branches

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Not in a git repository"**
- Solution: Initialize git repository (`git init`)

**"Uncommitted changes"**
- Solution: Commit changes (`git add . && git commit`) or stash (`git stash`)

**"Issue not found"**
- Solution: Check issue number with `swissarmyhammer issue list`

**"Branch already exists"**
- Solution: Switch to existing branch or delete old branch

```markdown
# Issue Management User Guide

This guide covers the complete workflow for managing issues in SwissArmyHammer.

## Overview

SwissArmyHammer's issue management system provides a lightweight, git-friendly way to track work items directly in your repository. Issues are stored as markdown files with sequential numbering and can be managed through both MCP tools and CLI commands.

## Directory Structure

```
your-project/
â”œâ”€â”€ issues/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 000001_implement_auth.md      # Active issue
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 000002_fix_bug.md            # Active issue
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ complete/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ 000003_add_tests.md      # Completed issue
â”œâ”€â”€ .git/
â””â”€â”€ your-code/
```

## Workflow Patterns

### Basic Workflow

1. **Create Issue**: Define what needs to be done
2. **Work on Issue**: Switch to dedicated branch
3. **Update Progress**: Document work as you go
4. **Mark Complete**: Signal work is finished
5. **Merge**: Integrate work into main branch

### Advanced Workflow

1. **Project Planning**: Create multiple issues for features
2. **Priority Management**: Work on issues in order
3. **Progress Tracking**: Regular updates and status checks
4. **Team Coordination**: Use issue status for team awareness
5. **Historical Record**: Completed issues provide project history

## Best Practices

### Issue Naming

- Use descriptive, action-oriented names
- Use underscores instead of spaces
- Keep names under 50 characters
- Examples: `implement_auth`, `fix_login_bug`, `add_user_dashboard`

### Issue Content

- Use markdown for formatting
- Include acceptance criteria
- Add relevant links and references
- Update with progress notes
- Keep content focused and organized

### Git Workflow

- Always work on issue branches
- Make atomic commits with clear messages
- Keep branches up to date with main
- Complete issues before merging
- Use descriptive commit messages

### Team Coordination

- Check issue status before starting work
- Update issues with progress regularly
- Use issue comments for team communication
- Mark issues complete when work is done
- Review completed issues in team meetings

## Troubleshooting

### Git Repository Issues

**Problem**: "Not in a git repository"
**Solution**: Initialize git repository in your project directory:
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

**Problem**: "Uncommitted changes prevent operation"
**Solution**: Commit or stash your changes:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Work in progress"
# or
git stash
```

### Issue Management Issues

**Problem**: "Issue not found"
**Solution**: Check available issues:
```bash
swissarmyhammer issue list
```

**Problem**: "Branch already exists"
**Solution**: Switch to existing branch or delete it:
```bash
git checkout issue/000001_issue_name
# or
git branch -D issue/000001_issue_name
```

### Performance Issues

**Problem**: Slow issue operations with many issues
**Solution**: Use filtering and pagination:
```bash
swissarmyhammer issue list --active
swissarmyhammer issue list --format json | jq '.[] | select(.completed == false)'
```

## Integration Examples

### With Claude Code

```
Human: Create an issue to implement user authentication
Assistant: I'll create an issue to track implementing user authentication.

issue_create name="implement_auth" content="# User Authentication Implementation

## Requirements

- [ ] Login endpoint with JWT token generation
- [ ] Password validation and hashing
- [ ] Protected routes middleware
- [ ] Role-based permissions
- [ ] Session expiration handling
- [ ] Unit tests for all auth components
"
```

## Proposed Solution

After analyzing the existing documentation, I see that SwissArmyHammer already has:

1. **README.md** - Contains basic issue tracking section (lines 63-102)
2. **doc/src/issue-management.md** - Existing comprehensive guide with MCP tools reference

The issue is requesting much more extensive documentation than what currently exists. My approach will be:

### 1. Expand README.md Issue Management Section
- Keep the existing structure but greatly expand the content
- Add the comprehensive features list, lifecycle, and tools reference as specified in the issue
- Include troubleshooting, best practices, and integration examples
- This will replace the current brief section with the full documentation

### 2. Replace/Enhance User Guide
- The existing `doc/src/issue-management.md` will be replaced with the much more comprehensive guide
- Add detailed CLI commands reference (the current guide only shows MCP usage)
- Include workflow patterns, integration examples, and extensive troubleshooting
- Add performance optimization tips and team coordination guidance

### 3. Implementation Strategy
- Use Test Driven Development approach by first creating documentation tests
- Verify all documented CLI commands and MCP tools work as described
- Ensure examples are accurate and functional
- Test documentation completeness against actual functionality

### 4. Key Improvements Over Current Documentation
- **CLI Commands**: Current docs only show MCP usage, missing CLI commands entirely
- **Troubleshooting**: Current docs have minimal troubleshooting, expansion needed
- **Advanced Usage**: Current docs are basic, need advanced patterns and workflows
- **Integration**: Current docs have minimal integration examples
- **Completeness**: Current docs are partial, need comprehensive coverage

This will provide users with complete, accurate, and practical documentation for the issue management system.
