When we pipe the prompt to claude:


2025-07-11T16:34:04.216755Z DEBUG swissarmyhammer::workflow::actions: Piping prompt to Claude:
DO NOT run any tools to perform this task:

Please greet {{ name }} in {{ language | default: 'English' }} and provide an English translation. Make it warm and friendly.


It looks like you are sending this along to Claude without renering the liqui first.

Which sorta tells me you have a duplicate and inconsistent path to get a rendered template.

This should show the actual post liquid render, the text actually sent to Claude.

And use a single code path shared with rendering for MCP and the test subcommand.

And -- there is a default for that parameter, and I didn't set it that got me an error.

So -- all the variables need to at least be None https://shopify.github.io/liquid/filters/default/ so that | default works

## Proposed Solution

1. Create an `extract_template_variables` function in template.rs that identifies all variables used in a liquid template
2. Update `Template::render` method to:
   - Extract all variables from the template
   - Initialize all variables as liquid nil/None
   - Override with provided args values
3. Update `Prompt::render` and `Prompt::render_with_partials` methods to use the same pattern
4. Update workflow actions debug logging to show the rendered prompt (post-liquid) instead of the raw template
5. Ensure consistent code paths for rendering across MCP, test subcommand, and workflow actions
6. Add tests to verify the `| default` filter works when variables are not provided
