when running search or index at the root of a repository, this case swissarmyhammer itself, the semantic db was created in my home directory.

i already gave you an issue about this, I really mean it -- the semantic db should NEVER be in the user home directory, it ONLY should be in a .swissarmyhammer directory in a local repository


get to it, don't fuck this up yet again.
