run workflow action needs to just -- run the workflow, not start another process

in particular, the code is confused and is passing claude parameters to swissarmyhammer

but there is *no good reason* to shell swissarmyhammer when we can execute flows in process via api

## Proposed Solution

1. Replace the `Command::new("swissarmyhammer")` approach in `SubWorkflowAction::execute`
2. Instead, use the in-process workflow execution API:
   - Create a `WorkflowStorage::file_system()` to load workflows
   - Create a `WorkflowExecutor::new()` to execute workflows
   - Load the sub-workflow with `storage.get_workflow()`
   - Execute it with `executor.start_and_execute_workflow()`
3. Remove the incorrect claude parameters like `--dangerously-skip-permissions`
4. Pass the context variables properly through the workflow run context
5. Parse the execution results from the workflow run instead of parsing stdout
6. Add proper test coverage for the in-process execution
