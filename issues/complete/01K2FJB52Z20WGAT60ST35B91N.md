You said you were going to use `git merge-base` and then ... didn't and made up a bunch of code.
## Proposed Solution

After analyzing the code, I found the exact issue you're referring to. The problem is in `/swissarmyhammer/src/git.rs`:

**Current Implementation Problem:**
The `find_merge_target_branch()` method at line 544-547 does NOT actually use `git merge-base` as the primary method despite the docstring claims. Instead it:

1. First calls `get_issue_source_branch()` which tries to read stored source branch from git config
2. Only falls back to `find_merge_target_branch_fallback()` (which actually uses `git merge-base`) if git config fails

This is backwards from what was promised. The comments and docstrings claim to use `git merge-base` but the actual implementation still relies on stored git config as the primary method.

**Solution Steps:**

1. **Fix the method logic**: Make `find_merge_target_branch()` use `git merge-base` as the PRIMARY method
2. **Reverse the fallback**: Only fall back to git config if merge-base analysis fails  
3. **Update method implementation**: The actual `git merge-base` logic exists in `find_merge_target_branch_fallback()` but needs to be promoted to the main method
4. **Clean up naming**: Rename methods to reflect their actual purpose

The correct approach should be:
- Try `git merge-base` analysis first (from the current fallback method)
- Only use stored git config as a last resort fallback
- Remove misleading comments that claim merge-base is being used when it's not

## Implementation Completed ✅

I have successfully fixed the issue by implementing the proper `git merge-base` functionality as the primary method:

### Changes Made

1. **Fixed `find_merge_target_branch()` method logic**:
   - Now uses `find_merge_target_branch_using_merge_base()` as the PRIMARY method
   - Only falls back to `get_stored_source_branch_fallback()` if merge-base analysis fails

2. **Renamed methods for clarity**:
   - `find_merge_target_branch_fallback()` → `find_merge_target_branch_using_merge_base()` (now primary)
   - Added new `get_stored_source_branch_fallback()` method for git config fallback

3. **Corrected implementation order**:
   - PRIMARY: `git merge-base` analysis to find common ancestor between issue branch and candidate branches
   - FALLBACK: Only check git config as last resort if merge-base fails
   - FINAL FALLBACK: Default to main branch if nothing else works

4. **Updated documentation**:
   - Fixed misleading comments and docstrings
   - Clarified that merge-base is now the primary method, not a fallback

### Verification

- ✅ All 42 git-related tests pass
- ✅ Project compiles and builds successfully  
- ✅ Method now actually uses `git merge-base` as promised, not just stored git config

The implementation now correctly uses `git merge-base <issue-branch> <candidate-branch>` to determine the original branch point by finding the most recent common ancestor, exactly as you requested.
