This output makes no sense -- I cannot tell what file has this 'tage' in it.

## Proposed Solution

After analyzing the validation warnings, I identified that the issue was not an actual typo in the content files, but rather a bug in the `YamlTypoValidator` implementation.

### Root Cause
The `YamlTypoValidator` was using `line.contains(typo)` which matches substrings, causing false positives like:
- "tage" being matched within "staged" 
- The validator was flagging legitimate words that contained the typo patterns as substrings

### Solution Implemented
Modified the `YamlTypoValidator` in `swissarmyhammer/src/validation/mod.rs` to:

1. **Split lines into words** using `split_whitespace()`
2. **Clean punctuation** from words using `trim_matches()` 
3. **Match whole words only** using exact string comparison (`==`)

This prevents false positives while still catching actual typos.

### Changes Made
- Updated `YamlTypoValidator::validate_content()` method to use word-boundary matching
- Added test case to verify substring matches are no longer flagged
- Maintained all existing functionality for legitimate typo detection

### Verification
- `cargo run validate` now passes without warnings
- All existing tests continue to pass
- New test case confirms "staged" no longer triggers "tage" warning

The fix resolves the validation warnings while maintaining accurate typo detection for actual spelling mistakes.
