# Step 1: Initialize Rust Project and Basic Structure

## Goal
Create the initial Rust project structure for swissarmyhammer with proper dependencies and configuration.

## Context
We're building an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server in Rust that allows users to create prompts as markdown files with YAML front matter. This first step establishes the foundation.

## Requirements
1. Initialize a new Rust project named `swissarmyhammer`
2. Set up Cargo.toml with initial dependencies:
   - `tokio` with full features for async runtime
   - `clap` for CLI argument parsing
   - `serde` and `serde_yaml` for YAML parsing
   - `serde_json` for JSON handling
   - `anyhow` for error handling
   - `tracing` and `tracing-subscriber` for logging
3. Create basic project structure:
   - `src/main.rs` with a simple "Hello, swissarmyhammer!" entry point
   - `src/lib.rs` for library code
   - `var/prompts/` directory for built-in prompts (empty for now)
4. Add a basic README.md explaining what swissarmyhammer is
5. Configure rustfmt.toml and clippy settings for code quality

## Implementation Notes
- Use Rust 2021 edition
- Set up proper module structure from the start
- Configure logging to stderr (since stdout will be used for MCP protocol)
- Make sure the project compiles and runs successfully

## Success Criteria
- `cargo build` completes successfully
- `cargo run` prints "Hello, swissarmyhammer!"
- Project structure is clean and follows Rust best practices
