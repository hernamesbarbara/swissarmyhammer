# Step 74: Extend Doctor Command for Workflow Diagnostics

## Goal
Enhance the doctor command to diagnose workflow-related issues and verify workflow system health.

## Context
The doctor command helps users diagnose configuration issues. It should be extended to check workflow system components.

## Requirements
1. Add workflow diagnostics:
   - Check workflow directories exist
   - Validate workflow file permissions
   - Test workflow parsing
   - Verify run storage accessible
   - Check for common issues
2. Diagnostic checks:
   - Workflow syntax validation
   - Missing dependencies
   - Storage space for runs
   - File system permissions
   - Workflow conflicts
3. Suggestions:
   - Fix permissions issues
   - Create missing directories
   - Resolve conflicts
   - Clean up old runs

## Implementation Notes
- Integrate with existing doctor command
- Non-invasive checks only
- Clear actionable output
- Test with minimal workflow
- Check for circular dependencies
- Verify all workflows parseable

## Success Criteria
- Doctor command includes workflow checks
- Identifies common workflow issues
- Provides helpful remediation steps
- Fast execution
- No false positives
