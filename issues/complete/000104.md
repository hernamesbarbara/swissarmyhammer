When running tests, we need to not load the actualy ~/.swissarmyhammer but
instead load a preconfigured substitute 'home directory' that is part of this repo
so that tests have a consistent environment in github actions.

## Proposed Solution

1. Create a test home directory structure at `tests/test-home/.swissarmyhammer` containing:
   - Sample prompts in `prompts/`
   - Sample workflows in `workflows/`
   - Other necessary test configuration files

2. Implement a test helper function that sets up the test environment by:
   - Setting the HOME environment variable to the test home directory
   - Ensuring all code respects this override

3. Update all existing tests to use the test home directory helper

4. Verify that all tests pass consistently in GitHub Actions

This approach leverages the existing HOME environment variable override pattern already used in some tests, but standardizes it across the entire test suite.
