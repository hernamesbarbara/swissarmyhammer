review and update the documentation to reflect the current state of the code

## Proposed Solution

After reviewing the current codebase and documentation, I've identified several key areas that need updating to reflect the current state:

### Current State Analysis

1. **MCP Tools**: The system now has a sophisticated tool registry pattern with structured tools for:
   - Issues: create, list, show, work, merge, mark_complete, update, all_complete
   - Memoranda: create, delete, get, list, search, update, get_all_context  
   - Search: index, query

2. **CLI Commands**: The current CLI structure includes:
   - `serve` - MCP server mode
   - `doctor` - Diagnostics
   - `prompt` - Prompt management
   - `flow` - Workflow execution
   - `completion` - Shell completions
   - `validate` - Validation
   - `issue` - Issue management
   - `memo` - Memoranda management
   - `search` - Semantic search
   - `config` - Configuration

3. **Architecture Changes**: The codebase has evolved from simple prompt management to a comprehensive MCP server with:
   - Tool registry pattern
   - Advanced error handling
   - Issue tracking system
   - Memoranda system
   - Semantic search capabilities

### Documentation Updates Needed

1. **Update README.md**: Reflect current CLI commands and MCP tool capabilities
2. **Update CLI Documentation**: Ensure all commands are properly documented
3. **Update MCP Integration Guide**: Include new tools and usage patterns
4. **Update Examples**: Provide current examples for new features
5. **Verify Installation Instructions**: Ensure they work with current codebase

### Implementation Steps

1. Update main README.md with current feature set
2. Review and update CLI reference documentation
3. Update MCP integration examples
4. Verify all code examples and snippets
5. Update feature documentation for new capabilities
