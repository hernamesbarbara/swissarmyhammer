# Step 77: Comprehensive Workflow Integration Testing

## Goal
Create thorough integration tests that verify the workflow system works correctly end-to-end with all components integrated.

## Context
With all workflow components implemented, we need comprehensive tests to ensure they work together correctly.

## Requirements
1. End-to-end test scenarios:
   - Complete workflow execution
   - Resume after interruption
   - Parallel execution
   - Error handling and recovery
   - Nested workflows
2. Integration test infrastructure:
   - Mock Claude API responses
   - Test workflow fixtures
   - Assertion helpers
   - Performance benchmarks
3. Test coverage for:
   - CLI commands
   - Parser edge cases
   - Storage operations
   - Concurrent execution
   - Resource cleanup

## Implementation Notes
- Use test workflows in `tests/workflows/`
- Mock external dependencies
- Test both success and failure paths
- Verify file system state
- Check for resource leaks
- Test interruption scenarios
- Measure execution times

## Success Criteria
- All major features tested
- Tests are reliable and fast
- Good error scenario coverage
- Performance benchmarks pass
- No flaky tests

## Proposed Solution

1. Create test workflow fixtures in `tests/workflows/` directory
   - Simple workflow for basic execution testing
   - Complex workflow with fork/join for parallel testing
   - Choice workflow for conditional logic testing
   - Nested workflow for sub-workflow testing
   - Error workflow for failure testing

2. Create comprehensive CLI integration tests
   - Test `flow run` command with various scenarios
   - Test `flow resume` command for interrupted workflows
   - Test `flow list`, `flow status`, `flow logs` commands
   - Test `flow metrics` and `flow visualize` commands
   - Test timeout and signal handling

3. Create parser edge case tests
   - Test invalid workflow YAML formats
   - Test missing required fields
   - Test circular dependencies
   - Test invalid state references
   - Test complex CEL expressions

4. Create storage operation tests
   - Test workflow and run persistence
   - Test concurrent access to storage
   - Test storage cleanup and recovery

5. Create performance benchmarks
   - Benchmark workflow parsing and loading
   - Benchmark workflow execution with various sizes
   - Benchmark parallel state execution
   - Benchmark storage operations

6. Create test helpers and infrastructure
   - Mock Claude API client for action execution
   - Test workflow builders for easy fixture creation
   - Assertion helpers for workflow state verification
   - Performance measurement utilities
