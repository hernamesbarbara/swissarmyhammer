Claude code reports 'no capabilities' for the MCP server, I expect to see prompts.

I see you hand coded an MCP server. You must use rmcp:

Here is an example
https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/rust-sdk/blob/main/examples/servers/src/common/calculator.rs

I see also that you built the MCP server in the cli, which is just stupid -- there is a server.rs in the swissarmyhammer library which is where it should go -- and be tested.

The CLI -- needs to just invoke the library, it has too much logic in it. Do a better job separating UI/CLI from logic.
