Partials do not require front matter.

Make sure that validate doesn't report front matter missing errors in this case.

Example:

review_format.md
  ERROR [-] Missing required field: title
    ðŸ’¡ Add a title field to the YAML front matter
  ERROR [-] Missing required field: description
    ðŸ’¡ Add a description field to the YAML front matter
  ERROR [-] Undefined template variable: 'component_type'
    ðŸ’¡ Add 'component_type' to the arguments list or remove the template variable
  ERROR [-] Missing required field: title
    ðŸ’¡ Add a title field to the YAML front matter
  ERROR [-] Missing required field: description
    ðŸ’¡ Add a description field to the YAML front matter
  ERROR [-] Missing required field: title
    ðŸ’¡ Add a title field to the YAML front matter
  ERROR [-] Missing required field: description
    ðŸ’¡ Add a description field to the YAML front matter
  WARN [-] Unused argument: 'language'
    ðŸ’¡ Remove 'language' from arguments or use it in the template


This is wrong in that

- it is checking frontmatter in a partial
- title and description are appearing multiple times, but we only have one file name, so grouping by file isn't happening correctly

## Proposed Solution

1. Enhance partial detection logic to recognize files without front matter as potential partials
2. Fix error deduplication in the validation output to group errors properly by file
3. Add a more explicit way to mark files as partials (either through naming convention like `_partial.md` or a special marker)
4. Ensure that validation skips front matter requirements for identified partials
5. Add tests to verify partial validation behavior
