`flow list` needs to look like `prompt list`

## Proposed Solution
1. Update the `list_workflows_command` function in `flow.rs` to use a 2-line format similar to `prompt list`
2. Display workflow name and description in a 2-line format:
   - First line: NAME | DESCRIPTION (first part)
   - Second line: Indented full description
3. Add empty lines between entries for better readability
4. Consider adding color coding if workflows have different sources (builtin vs user-defined)
5. Ensure consistency with the prompt list output format
