The `prompt test` command needs a --set to be more consistent with `flow run`.


We need a `flow test` command that simulates a dry run without actually calling Claude.
For this we'll need a simulated 'test mode' Claude that just echoes the input prompt.

## Proposed Solution

1. **Add --set parameter to prompt test command**:
   - Modify the PromptSubcommand::Test struct in cli.rs to add a `set` field similar to FlowSubcommand::Run
   - Update test.rs to handle set variables by storing them as template variables in the liquid rendering context
   - The --set variables will be used for liquid template rendering in prompt content, consistent with flow run

2. **Implement flow test command**:
   - Add a new Test variant to FlowSubcommand enum in cli.rs  
   - The command will accept the same parameters as `flow run` but execute in test mode
   - Create a test mode action executor that:
     - Logs the action string instead of executing it
     - For Claude prompts, echoes the rendered prompt content
     - Sets mock success results in workflow context
   - Leverage the existing test mode infrastructure from execute_workflow_test_mode
   - Generate the same coverage report as `flow run --test`

3. **Implementation approach**:
   - The existing `flow run --test` functionality provides a good foundation
   - Extract the test mode logic into a reusable function
   - Add proper handling for Claude action mocking to echo prompts
   - Ensure both commands maintain consistency in parameter handling
