We need a prompt subcommand much like the flow subcommand.

This will move the prompt handling commands.

- prompt list
- prompt validate
- prompt test
- prompt search


This should end up symmetric with the `flow` command.

## Proposed Solution

To create a `prompt` subcommand that is symmetric with the `flow` subcommand, I will:

1. **Create PromptSubcommand enum in cli.rs**: Define an enum similar to FlowSubcommand that contains List, Validate, Test, and Search variants with their respective parameters

2. **Add Prompt command to Commands enum**: Add a new Prompt variant that takes a PromptSubcommand, just like Flow takes FlowSubcommand

3. **Create prompt.rs module**: Create a new module file that will contain:
   - `run_prompt_command()` function that dispatches to the appropriate subcommand handler
   - Move existing command implementations to this module

4. **Update main.rs**: 
   - Add `mod prompt;` declaration
   - Update the match statement to handle `Commands::Prompt` by calling `prompt::run_prompt_command()`
   - Remove the individual List, Validate, Test, Search cases from the Commands enum

5. **Preserve existing functionality**: All the existing parameters and behavior of the commands will remain the same, they'll just be accessed via `swissarmyhammer prompt <subcommand>` instead of `swissarmyhammer <command>`

This will result in a symmetric structure where both flow and prompt have their own subcommands:
- `swissarmyhammer flow <subcommand>` (existing)
- `swissarmyhammer prompt <subcommand>` (new)
