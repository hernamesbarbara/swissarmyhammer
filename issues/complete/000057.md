I need you to think *really hard* and not fuck this up.

When I add or change a prompt on disk, it really needs to communicate this over MCP.

Do the list change https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/server/prompts#list-changed-notification -- and test it.

There really is support https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/rust-sdk/blob/31155a440c094c4349ec1e18df156d5b992867fa/crates/rmcp/src/model/capabilities.rs#L224

DO NOT FAIL ME.
