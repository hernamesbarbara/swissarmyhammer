Workflow files should not be .yaml -- these should be .md with front matter-- markdown
that contain mermaid inline.

## Proposed Solution

After analyzing the current workflow system, I found that:

1. The current WorkflowResolver only processes `.mermaid` files (line 48 in storage.rs)
2. Existing workflow files are named `.yaml` but are actually markdown with YAML front matter and mermaid diagrams
3. No `.mermaid` files exist in the system

The solution involves:

1. **Update WorkflowResolver parsing logic**: Change the file extension check from `.mermaid` to `.md` in the WorkflowResolver
2. **Rename existing workflow files**: Convert all `.yaml` workflow files to `.md` extension (they're already in the correct format)
3. **Update tests**: Ensure all tests handle the new `.md` workflow format
4. **Update file watcher**: Make sure the file watcher includes `.md` files for workflow detection

This change will make the workflow file naming consistent with the intended design where workflows are markdown files with YAML front matter containing mermaid diagrams inline.
