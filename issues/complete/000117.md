We need to rearrange builtins

/prompts/builtin
/workflows/builtin

needs to be 

/builtin
  /prompts
  /workflows

We need all builtin to pass validation as a unit test.

## Proposed Solution
1. Create new directory structure /builtin with subdirectories /prompts and /workflows
2. Move all files from /prompts/builtin to /builtin/prompts
3. Move all files from /workflows/builtin to /builtin/workflows
4. Update all code references to the old paths
5. Create or update unit tests to validate all builtin prompts and workflows
6. Remove old empty directories
