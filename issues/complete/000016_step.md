# Step 16: Add List Command to CLI

## Goal
Implement a `list` command that allows users to see all available prompts without running the MCP server.

## Context
Currently, users have no way to discover what prompts are available without starting the server or manually browsing directories. A list command would greatly improve the user experience.

## Requirements
1. Add `list` subcommand to the CLI
   - Display all prompts from all three sources (built-in, user, local)
   - Show prompt name, title, and description
   - Indicate source of each prompt (built-in/user/local)
   - Show override information when prompts shadow each other
2. Add formatting options:
   - `--format` flag with options: table (default), json, yaml
   - `--verbose` flag to show full details including arguments
   - `--source` filter to show only prompts from specific source
   - `--category` filter to show prompts from specific category
3. Add search/filter capabilities:
   - `--search` to filter by name or description
4. Color-coded output:
   - Different colors for different sources
   - Highlight overridden prompts
   - Use dimmed text for descriptions

## Implementation Notes
- Reuse the PromptLoader logic for discovering prompts
- Use `tabled` or similar crate for nice table formatting
- Ensure output is pipe-friendly (detect TTY)
- Consider pagination for large prompt collections

## Success Criteria
- `swissarmyhammer list` shows all available prompts in a readable format
- Users can quickly find prompts they're looking for
- Output clearly indicates which prompts override others
- JSON/YAML output can be parsed by other tools
- Performance is fast even with many prompts
