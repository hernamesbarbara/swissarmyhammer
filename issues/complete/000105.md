Workflow and Prompt loading is similar in that it is a stack of directory overrides.

Combine all file loading of the .swissarmyhammer directories, overriding by name to end up
with a map of path->file.

Use this as a virtual file system to load prompts and workflows rather than direct file access.

The idea is to make sure we load files in the same way across the workflow and prompt features.

And this is a way to consolidate duplicated code.

## Proposed Solution

1. Create a new module `src/file_loader.rs` that implements a unified virtual file system for loading files from `.swissarmyhammer` directories.

2. Design the module with these key components:
   - `FileSource` enum: Track whether a file came from Builtin, User, or Local sources
   - `VirtualFileSystem` struct: Main abstraction that handles directory scanning and file loading
   - `FileEntry` struct: Represents a file with its path, content, and source
   - `DirectoryWalker` utility: Encapsulate the logic for walking up directory trees

3. Key features to implement:
   - Directory precedence handling (builtin → user → local)
   - File override by name across directories
   - Configurable subdirectory support (e.g., "prompts" or "workflows")
   - Cached file map for efficient access
   - Security limits (MAX_DIRECTORY_DEPTH)

4. Refactor existing code:
   - Update `PromptResolver` to use `VirtualFileSystem` instead of custom directory walking
   - Update `WorkflowResolver` to use `VirtualFileSystem` instead of custom directory walking
   - Remove duplicated directory traversal logic from both modules

5. Testing strategy:
   - Unit tests for VirtualFileSystem with mock directories
   - Integration tests to ensure prompts and workflows still load correctly
   - Test precedence rules and file overriding behavior
   - Test security limits and edge cases
