# Step 78: Integrate Workflows with MCP Server

## Goal
Extend the MCP server to expose workflows alongside prompts, enabling Claude Code to discover and execute workflows.

## Context
The MCP server currently serves prompts. We need to extend it to also serve workflows and handle workflow execution requests.

## Requirements
1. MCP protocol extensions:
   - Workflows are Tools
   - List available workflows
   - Execute workflow via MCP
   - Report workflow status
   - Stream execution updates
2. Notification support:
   - Workflow file changes
   - Execution progress
   - State transitions
   - Completion events
3. MCP workflow features:
   - Pass variables via MCP
   - Return execution results
   - Handle long-running workflows
   - Support cancellation

## Implementation Notes
- Extend existing MCP implementation
- Workflows are Tools
- Use MCP streaming for progress
- Handle disconnections gracefully
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Add workflow-specific metadata

## Success Criteria
- Workflows accessible via MCP
- Claude Code can execute workflows
- Progress updates work
- File watching includes workflows
- Clean integration with existing MCP code

## Proposed Solution

Based on analysis of the current codebase, SwissArmyHammer has a mature MCP server focused on prompt management and a comprehensive workflow system, but workflows are not yet integrated with the MCP server.

### Implementation Plan

1. **Extend MCP Server Capabilities**
   - Add `tools: Some(ToolsCapability { list_changed: Some(true) })` to server capabilities
   - Implement workflow operations as MCP tools
   - Maintain backward compatibility with existing prompt functionality

2. **Implement Workflow Tools**
   - `workflow_run`: Execute a workflow with optional variables
   - `workflow_status`: Get current status of a workflow run
   - `workflow_list`: List available workflows
   - `workflow_resume`: Resume an interrupted workflow
   - `workflow_logs`: Get execution logs for a workflow run
   - `workflow_metrics`: Get performance metrics for workflows
   - `workflow_visualize`: Generate workflow visualization

3. **Add Resource Capability (Optional)**
   - Expose workflow definitions as MCP resources
   - Support workflow file watching and notifications
   - Allow dynamic workflow loading

4. **Integration Architecture**
   - Extend existing `McpServer` struct to include workflow executor
   - Add async integration between MCP requests and workflow execution
   - Implement proper error handling and status reporting
   - Add notification support for workflow execution updates

5. **File Watching Integration**
   - Extend existing file watcher to include workflow files
   - Send notifications when workflow files change
   - Trigger workflow list refresh on file changes

6. **Testing Strategy**
   - Unit tests for new MCP tool handlers
   - Integration tests for workflow execution via MCP
   - End-to-end tests with mock MCP client
   - Performance tests for long-running workflows

### Technical Details

- **Location**: Extend `/Users/wballard/github/swissarmyhammer/swissarmyhammer/src/mcp.rs`
- **Dependencies**: Leverage existing workflow executor and storage systems
- **Async Handling**: Use existing async infrastructure for long-running workflows
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error reporting across MCP and workflow systems
