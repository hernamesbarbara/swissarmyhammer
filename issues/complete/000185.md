You made things too hard -- numbered and named issues are -- just the same:

use entire filename (without .md) as name

don't make a distinction about there being a number -- the number is *just a convention* to force ordering of files

so file to issue name goes like this

000001_paper.md --> 000001_paper
nice.md --> nice
000001.md --> 000001
373c4cf9-d803-4138-89b3-bc802d22f94e.md --> 373c4cf9-d803-4138-89b3-bc802d22f94e

i.e. -- just strip off the name .md and don't make this convoluted

When we create an issue with the API or cli -- the name is just an ulid -- this way they are lexicographical
and we don't need to think about counting numbers of keeping track -- just make a new ulid and it's gonna be higher numbered

So - * eliminate IssueNumber from this code * really, we do not need it

eliminate issue.number -- no fooling we do not need it


make a pass through all the code and verify that there is *only one* spot where we are processing issue file name parsing and issue file system iteration -- eliminate code duplication to make sure we have one tested path

## Proposed Solution

After analyzing the codebase, here's my implementation plan:

### Current Problems Found:
1. **Duplicate IssueNumber types** in `mcp/types.rs` and `issues/filesystem.rs`
2. **Issue.number field** still exists and used throughout the codebase
3. **Multiple overlapping parsing functions**:
   - `parse_issue_filename` (numbered format only)
   - `parse_any_issue_filename` (both numbered and non-numbered)  
   - `extract_issue_name_from_filename` (name extraction)
4. **CLI operations still number-based** (show, update, complete commands)
5. **Complex virtual number logic** for non-numbered files

### Implementation Steps:
1. **Eliminate IssueNumber type entirely** from both locations
2. **Remove issue.number field** from Issue struct
3. **Replace with single parsing function**: `get_issue_name_from_filename(filename: &str) -> String`
   - Just strips .md extension and returns the remaining filename as the issue name
   - No number parsing, no complex logic
4. **Update Issue struct** to use only `name: String` field
5. **Update all storage APIs** to work with issue names instead of numbers
6. **Update CLI commands** to use names instead of numbers
7. **Update all tests** to reflect the simplified approach
8. **Remove all virtual number generation logic**

### Key Changes:
- `000001_paper.md` → issue name = `000001_paper`
- `nice.md` → issue name = `nice`  
- `000001.md` → issue name = `000001`
- `373c4cf9-d803-4138-89b3-bc802d22f94e.md` → issue name = `373c4cf9-d803-4138-89b3-bc802d22f94e`

This eliminates all the complexity around numbered vs non-numbered files and makes the system much simpler and more consistent.
