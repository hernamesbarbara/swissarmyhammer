# Step 148: Create Issue Module Structure and Basic Data Types

## Goal
Create the foundational module structure for issue management in SwissArmyHammer, defining the basic data types and interfaces that will be used throughout the issue tracking system.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Create New Module File
- Add `swissarmyhammer/src/issues.rs` to the library
- Add module declaration in `swissarmyhammer/src/lib.rs`

### 2. Define Core Data Structures

```rust
/// Represents an issue in the tracking system
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct Issue {
    /// The issue number (6-digit format)
    pub number: u32,
    /// The issue name (derived from filename without number prefix)
    pub name: String,
    /// The full content of the issue markdown file
    pub content: String,
    /// Whether the issue is completed
    pub completed: bool,
    /// The file path of the issue
    pub file_path: PathBuf,
}

/// Represents the current state of the issue system
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub struct IssueState {
    /// Path to the issues directory
    pub issues_dir: PathBuf,
    /// Path to the completed issues directory
    pub completed_dir: PathBuf,
}
```

### 3. Define Error Types
Add issue-specific error variants to `SwissArmyHammerError`:
- `IssueNotFound(String)` - When an issue cannot be found
- `InvalidIssueNumber(String)` - When issue number format is invalid
- `IssueAlreadyExists(u32)` - When trying to create a duplicate issue

### 4. Define Core Traits

```rust
/// Trait for issue storage operations
pub trait IssueStorage: Send + Sync {
    /// List all issues (both pending and completed)
    async fn list_issues(&self) -> Result<Vec<Issue>>;
    
    /// Get a specific issue by number
    async fn get_issue(&self, number: u32) -> Result<Issue>;
    
    /// Create a new issue with auto-assigned number
    async fn create_issue(&self, name: String, content: String) -> Result<Issue>;
}
```

### 5. Basic Implementation Structure
Create `FileSystemIssueStorage` struct that will implement the `IssueStorage` trait in subsequent steps.

## Testing
- Unit tests for Issue struct serialization/deserialization
- Tests for issue number validation
- Tests for path construction

## Success Criteria
- Module compiles without errors
- Basic data structures are defined
- Module is properly integrated into the library
- Tests pass for basic functionality

## Proposed Solution
1. Create a new `issues.rs` module file in the swissarmyhammer/src directory
2. Add the module declaration to lib.rs 
3. Define the Issue struct with serde Serialize/Deserialize derives
4. Define the IssueState struct for managing issue directories
5. Add new error variants to SwissArmyHammerError enum for issue-specific errors
6. Define the IssueStorage trait with async methods for listing, getting, and creating issues
7. Create a basic FileSystemIssueStorage struct that will implement the trait
8. Write comprehensive unit tests for:
   - Issue struct serialization/deserialization
   - Issue number validation 
   - Path construction logic
9. Ensure all tests pass and the module integrates cleanly with the existing codebase
