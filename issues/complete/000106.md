When we invoke claude as a subprocess, we want to 

`--output-format stream-json`


But JSON streams are hard to read, so each JSON streamed:
- log the json stream for our workflow run
- reformat each json as YAML and stream it to stdout for user visibility
- add a --quiet switch that will disable the stdout and just log

## Proposed Solution

1. Added a `quiet` field to `PromptAction` struct to control output visibility
2. Created `parse_and_display_claude_response` function that:
   - Logs each JSON line using `tracing::debug!`
   - Converts JSON to YAML and prints to stderr (unless quiet mode)
   - Parses and collects content from the JSON stream
3. Added support for `_quiet` context variable that can be set in workflows
4. Added builder method `with_quiet()` to configure quiet mode on actions
5. Added tests to verify the functionality

The implementation ensures that:
- JSON streams are always logged for debugging/audit purposes
- YAML output provides better readability for users
- Quiet mode suppresses stdout but maintains logging
- The feature is backward compatible with existing workflows
