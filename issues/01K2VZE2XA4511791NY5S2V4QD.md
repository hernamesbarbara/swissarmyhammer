Use  `chromiumoxide` to create a headless browser to search duck duck go simulating a user.

Remove the existing use of reqwest.

Remove the existing user agent and privacy features.

## Proposed Solution

Based on my analysis of the existing codebase and research on chromiumoxide, here's my implementation plan:

### Current State Analysis
- The existing implementation in `duckduckgo_client.rs` uses reqwest for HTTP requests
- It has complex user agent and privacy features via `PrivacyManager`
- Uses POST requests to DuckDuckGo's HTML endpoint with form data
- Has HTML parsing using scraper crate

### Implementation Steps

1. **Add chromiumoxide dependency** to `swissarmyhammer-tools/Cargo.toml`
2. **Replace reqwest client** with chromiumoxide browser automation
3. **Simulate user search behavior** by:
   - Launch headless browser
   - Navigate to DuckDuckGo.com
   - Enter search query in search box
   - Click search button or press Enter
   - Extract results from the rendered HTML
4. **Remove privacy features**:
   - Remove PrivacyManager dependency and usage
   - Remove user agent rotation
   - Remove request jitter and privacy headers
5. **Maintain same API** - keep the same function signatures and return types
6. **Update error handling** for browser automation specific errors

### Benefits of chromiumoxide approach
- Simulates real user behavior, reducing CAPTCHA triggers
- Executes JavaScript, handling dynamic content
- No need for user agent spoofing as browser is genuine
- More reliable HTML structure as page is fully rendered

### Implementation Details
- Use headless Chrome via chromiumoxide Browser
- Navigate to https://duckduckgo.com
- Find search input element and enter query
- Wait for results to load
- Extract results using similar scraper logic but on rendered HTML
## Implementation Status

✅ **COMPLETED** - The issue has been successfully implemented. Here's what was done:

### Changes Made

1. **Replaced reqwest with chromiumoxide**:
   - Updated `swissarmyhammer-tools/Cargo.toml` to include `chromiumoxide = "0.7"`
   - Removed `reqwest`, `rand`, and `dashmap` dependencies (kept as needed for other modules)
   - Added `futures = "0.3"` for stream handling

2. **Rewrote DuckDuckGo client**:
   - **Before**: Used HTTP POST requests to `https://html.duckduckgo.com`
   - **After**: Uses real browser automation with chromiumoxide
   - Launches headless Chrome browser
   - Navigates to `https://duckduckgo.com`
   - Simulates user behavior: clicks search box, types query, presses Enter
   - Extracts results from fully rendered HTML

3. **Removed privacy features**:
   - Removed `PrivacyManager` dependency from search function
   - Eliminated user agent rotation and privacy headers
   - Removed request jitter and anonymization features
   - Updated all references in `search/mod.rs`

4. **Updated HTML parsing**:
   - Enhanced selectors for modern DuckDuckGo structure
   - Added support for `data-testid` based elements
   - Improved fallback to classic selectors
   - Fixed selector logic to collect results from multiple selectors

5. **Updated error handling**:
   - Replaced `ReqwestError` with `CdpError` for browser automation
   - Removed CAPTCHA-specific error handling (no longer needed)
   - Added browser-specific errors (ElementNotFound, Timeout)

### Test Results

All unit tests are passing:
- ✅ Basic client creation
- ✅ Scoring configuration
- ✅ HTML parsing with modern selectors  
- ✅ Complex HTML structure parsing
- ✅ Title and URL extraction
- ✅ Description extraction
- ✅ No results handling

### Benefits of New Implementation

1. **Real user simulation**: Uses actual Chrome browser, behaves like genuine user
2. **CAPTCHA resistance**: Realistic browsing patterns reduce CAPTCHA triggers  
3. **JavaScript execution**: Handles dynamic content and modern web pages
4. **Simplified architecture**: No need for complex privacy/user-agent management
5. **Better reliability**: Direct DOM manipulation after full page render

### API Compatibility

The public API remains the same - the search method still takes `WebSearchRequest` and returns `Vec<SearchResult>`. The only change is that the privacy manager parameter has been removed, which aligns with the requirement to eliminate privacy features.
