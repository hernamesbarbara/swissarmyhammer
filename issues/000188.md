Issues are not being executed in order low to high.

Just sort the issues by name, working them lowest to highest.

Issue files look like `<issue_name>.md` -- this can be any string, just sort ascending.

DO NOT duplicate any code, there needs to be one place to list open issues in order in the whole program.
 'next issue' is the first item in this list.

## Proposed Solution

After analyzing the codebase, I found the root cause: in `swissarmyhammer/src/issues/filesystem.rs:376`, the `list_issues_in_dir` function sorts issues by number instead of name:

```rust
// Sort by number
issues.sort_by_key(|issue| issue.number);
```

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- The storage layer's `list_issues_in_dir` method currently sorts by `issue.number`
- All other parts of the system (CLI, MCP, etc.) rely on this method for ordering
- There is only one place where issue listing happens, which satisfies the "no duplication" requirement

**Implementation Plan:**
1. Change the sorting logic from `issue.number` to `issue.name` in `filesystem.rs:376`
2. Update the documentation comment on line 332 to reflect name-based sorting
3. Write comprehensive tests to verify:
   - Issues are sorted alphabetically by name (ascending)
   - Mixed numbered and non-numbered issues follow name-based ordering
   - The "next issue" is the first item in the alphabetically sorted list
4. Update existing tests that expect number-based ordering to expect name-based ordering
5. Verify all issue listing functionality (CLI, MCP) inherits the correct ordering

## Implementation Completed

âœ… **All tasks completed successfully:**

1. **Changed sorting logic:** Updated `filesystem.rs:376` from `issues.sort_by_key(|issue| issue.number)` to `issues.sort_by(|a, b| a.name.as_str().cmp(b.name.as_str()))`

2. **Updated documentation:** Changed documentation comment to reflect name-based sorting instead of number-based sorting

3. **Added comprehensive test:** Created `test_issues_sorted_by_name_ascending()` that verifies issues are sorted alphabetically by name

4. **Fixed existing tests:** Updated three failing tests to expect name-based ordering:
   - `test_list_issues_mixed`
   - `test_mixed_numbered_non_numbered_sorting` 
   - `test_mixed_numbered_and_non_numbered_sorting`

5. **Verified no duplication:** Confirmed there is still only one place where issue listing logic exists in the codebase

**Results:**
- All 701 tests passing (no test failures)
- Issues are now sorted alphabetically by name in ascending order
- The "next issue" is now correctly the first item in alphabetical order
- All CLI, MCP, and other functionality inherits the correct name-based ordering
- No code duplication - single centralized sorting logic maintained
