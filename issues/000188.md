Issues are not being executed in order low to high.

Just sort the issues by name, working them lowest to highest.

Issue files look like `<issue_name>.md` -- this can be any string, just sort ascending.

DO NOT duplicate any code, there needs to be one place to list open issues in order in the whole program.
 'next issue' is the first item in this list.
