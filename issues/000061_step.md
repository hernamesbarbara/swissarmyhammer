# Step 61: Add Workflow Data Structures and Types

## Goal
Create the foundational data structures and types for the workflow system, establishing the core representation of workflows, states, transitions, and execution contexts.

## Context
We're implementing a new workflow system that will execute workflows defined as Mermaid state diagrams. This first step establishes the Rust types that will represent workflows throughout the system.

## Requirements
1. Create a new module `workflow` in the swissarmyhammer library
2. Define core data structures:
   - `Workflow` - Main workflow representation
   - `State` - Individual workflow states
   - `Transition` - State transitions with conditions
   - `WorkflowRun` - Runtime execution context
   - `WorkflowRunId` - Unique identifier for workflow runs
3. Implement serialization/deserialization traits for persistence
4. Add basic validation methods

## Implementation Notes
- Use strong typing to prevent invalid state transitions
- Design for future extensibility (parallel states, nested workflows)
- Include metadata fields for debugging and monitoring
- Consider using UUID for WorkflowRunId
- Add fields for:
  - State descriptions (what Claude should do)
  - Transition conditions
  - Fork/join points for parallel execution
  - Workflow metadata (name, version, description)

## Success Criteria
- New `workflow.rs` module created with all core types
- Types implement Serialize/Deserialize
- Basic unit tests for type creation and validation
- Documentation comments on all public types
- Compiles without warnings
