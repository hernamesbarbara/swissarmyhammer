# Final Integration Testing and Validation

## Overview
Perform comprehensive end-to-end testing of the completed web_fetch tool to ensure all specification requirements are met and the tool works correctly in real-world scenarios. Refer to /Users/wballard/github/sah-fetch/ideas/fetch.md.

## Tasks
- Validate all specification use cases work correctly
- Test complete MCP integration and tool discovery
- Run comprehensive test suite and ensure all tests pass
- Verify performance and security requirements are met
- Validate error handling and edge cases

## Implementation Details
- Test all use cases from specification: documentation research, API docs, content validation, news analysis
- Verify MCP protocol integration works correctly
- Run full test suite including unit, integration, and security tests
- Validate response formats match specification exactly
- Test tool with real AI workflows and typical usage patterns
- Verify logging and monitoring work correctly

## Success Criteria
- All specification use cases work as documented
- Complete test suite passes without failures
- Performance meets specification requirements
- Security controls work as intended
- Tool integrates seamlessly with existing MCP infrastructure
- Ready for production use

## Dependencies
- Requires fetch_000014_documentation-examples (for complete implementation)

## Estimated Impact
- Validates complete implementation
- Ensures production readiness
