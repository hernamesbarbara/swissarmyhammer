# Step 67: Add Fork/Join Support for Parallel Execution

## Goal
Implement fork and join states to enable parallel execution paths within workflows.

## Context
Workflows need to support parallel execution for efficiency. Mermaid supports fork/join syntax that we need to parse and execute.

## Requirements
1. Extend parser to support:
   - Fork syntax: `state fork_state <<fork>>`
   - Join syntax: `state join_state <<join>>`
   - Parallel paths between fork and join
2. Update executor to:
   - Detect fork states
   - Spawn parallel execution branches
   - Track parallel branch progress
   - Wait at join states for all branches
3. Handle parallel execution context:
   - Isolated variable scopes per branch
   - Merge strategies at join points
   - Conflict resolution

## Implementation Notes
- Use tokio tasks for parallel execution
- Each branch gets a copy of parent context
- Join states wait for all incoming branches
- Support nested fork/join structures
- Example syntax:
  ```mermaid
  stateDiagram-v2
      Process --> Fork1 <<fork>>
      Fork1 --> Branch1: path1
      Fork1 --> Branch2: path2
      Branch1 --> Join1 <<join>>
      Branch2 --> Join1 <<join>>
      Join1 --> Complete
  ```

## Success Criteria
- Parser recognizes fork/join syntax
- Executor spawns parallel branches
- Join states wait correctly
- Variable merging works
- Tests with complex parallel workflows
