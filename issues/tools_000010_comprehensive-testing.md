# Comprehensive Testing Suite for File Tools

Refer to /Users/wballard/github/sah-filetools/ideas/tools.md

## Objective
Create a comprehensive testing suite covering all file tools with unit tests, integration tests, security tests, and performance benchmarks.

## Analysis of Existing Test Coverage

### Current State (‚úÖ Well Covered)
- **`files_read` tool**: Excellent coverage in `file_tools_integration_tests.rs`
  - Basic functionality, offset/limit, error handling, security, edge cases
- **`files_glob` tool**: Good coverage with gitignore integration, case sensitivity, sorting
- **`files_grep` tool**: Comprehensive testing with output modes, filtering, fallback behavior  
- **`files_write` tool**: Complete unit tests in individual module (discovery!)
- **`files_edit` tool**: Complete unit tests in individual module (discovery!)
- **CLI command parsing**: Basic tests in `file.rs`

### Major Gaps Identified (‚ùå Missing)
1. **Integration Tests**: No tests for tool composition patterns
2. **Security Tests**: Limited workspace boundary and path traversal testing
3. **Performance Tests**: No benchmarking or large-scale operation tests
4. **Property-Based Tests**: No fuzzing or random input testing
5. **CLI Integration**: Limited end-to-end CLI testing for all file commands
6. **Cross-Tool Integration**: No tests combining multiple file tools in workflows

## Proposed Solution

### Phase 1: Enhanced Integration Testing
Create comprehensive integration tests that extend the existing `file_tools_integration_tests.rs`:

```rust
// Add write and edit tool integration tests to existing file
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_write_tool_integration() {
    // Test write tool through registry/MCP protocol
}

#[tokio::test] 
async fn test_edit_tool_integration() {
    // Test edit tool through registry/MCP protocol
}

// Tool composition patterns
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_read_then_edit_workflow() {
    // Read file, modify content, edit file
}

#[tokio::test]
async fn test_glob_then_grep_workflow() {
    // Find files with glob, search content with grep
}
```

### Phase 2: Security Test Enhancement
Add comprehensive security tests to the integration test suite:

```rust
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_comprehensive_path_traversal_protection() {
    // Test all tools against path traversal attacks
    // Test workspace boundary enforcement
    // Test symlink attack prevention
}

#[tokio::test]
async fn test_workspace_boundary_enforcement() {
    // Verify all tools respect workspace boundaries
}
```

### Phase 3: Performance Testing Infrastructure
Create new performance test file `file_tools_performance_tests.rs`:

```rust
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_large_file_operations_performance() {
    // Benchmark read/write/edit operations on large files
    // Memory usage profiling
    // Concurrent operation testing
}

#[tokio::test]
async fn test_directory_traversal_performance() {
    // Benchmark glob operations on large directory trees
    // Grep performance on large codebases
}
```

### Phase 4: Property-Based Testing Framework
Create `file_tools_property_tests.rs`:

```rust
use proptest::prelude::*;

proptest! {
    #[test]
    fn test_read_write_roundtrip(content in ".*") {
        // Property: write then read should return same content
    }
    
    #[test] 
    fn test_edit_consistency(
        original in ".*",
        old_string in ".*",
        new_string in ".*"
    ) {
        // Property: edit operations should be deterministic
    }
}
```

### Phase 5: Enhanced CLI Integration Testing
Extend existing CLI tests with comprehensive scenarios:

```rust
// In swissarmyhammer-cli/tests/file_cli_integration_tests.rs
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_file_command_end_to_end_workflows() {
    // Test complete CLI workflows using all file commands
}
```
